Geometric Transforms
1. Translate the given image (lena translate.png) by (tx = 3.75, ty = 4.3) pixels.
2. Rotate the given image (pisa rotate.png) about the image centre, so as to straighten the
Pisa tower.
3. Scale the given image (cells scale.png) by 0.8 and 1.3 factors.
NOTE : Use bilinear interpolation during target-to-source mapping.
