Updates in Version 1.2022 of the NCCN Guidelines for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer from Version 7.2021 include:
NSCL-18
• Establish histologic subtype with adequate tissue for molecular testing (consider rebiopsy or plasma testing if appropriate)
• Footnote nn modified: The NCCN NSCLC Guidelines Panel strongly advises broader molecular profiling with the goal of identifying rare 
driver mutations for which effective drugs may already be available, or to appropriately counsel patients regarding the availability of clinical 
trials. Broad molecular profiling is defined as molecular testing that identifies all biomarkers identified in NSCL-19 in either a single assay or 
a combination of a limited number of assays, and optimally also identifies emerging biomarkers (NSCL-I). Tiered approaches based on low 
prevalence of co-occurring biomarkers are acceptable.
NSCL-19

life of such drugs and data reporting adverse events when combining checkpoint inhibitors with using osimertinib in combination with or 
following checkpoint inhibitors.
NSCL-21
• Footnote ww modified: Consider a biopsy at time of progression to rule out SCLC transformation and evaluate mechanisms of resistance. 
(also applies to NSCL-22)
• Footnote yy modified: The data in the second-line setting suggest that PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy is less effective, irrespective of PD-
L1 expression, in EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R, ALK+ NSCLC. (also applies to NSCL-22, NSCL-27, NSCL-28)
NSCL-22
• T790M testing: category 1 added
• Subsequent therapy specifically noted for T790M-
• Footnote zz modified: Plasma or tissue-based testing via broad molecular profiling should be considered at progression, on EGFR TKIs 
for the T790M mutation and other genomic resistance mechanisms. If plasma-based testing is negative, tissue-based testing with rebiopsy 
material is strongly recommended. Practitioners may want to consider scheduling the biopsy concurrently with plasma testing referral. 
NSCL-23
• New page added with treatment recommendations for EGFR S768I, L861Q, and/or G719X
NSCL-24

Bullet 5 modified: Patients with pathologic stage II or greater, or high-risk factors, should be referred to medical oncology for evaluation.
NSCL-B 3 of 4
• The Role of Surgery in Patients with Stage IIIA NSCLC
Bullet 5 modified: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is used in 50%one-third of the NCCN Member Institutions, while neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy is used in the other 50%two-thirds.
• Data from the updated questionnaire (2021) included regarding the approach to patients with N2 disease at the NCCN Member Institutions
All NCCN institutions treat select N2 patients with multimodality therapy that includes surgery.
The majority of NCCN institutions prefer EBUS for initial mediastinal staging, reserving mediastinoscopy for possible restaging.
The majority of institutions do not pathologically restage mediastinal lymph nodes after induction therapy and prior to surgery.
All NCCN institutions consider surgery for single-station non-bulky N2 disease.
Approximately half of the institutions consider surgery for single-station bulky disease, 39% for multi-station non-bulky disease, and 21% 
for multi-station bulky disease.
Two-thirds of institutions prefer induction chemotherapy; one-third prefer chemoradiation.
The majority require at least stable disease after induction, but do not require radiologic or pathologic response prior to surgery.
Roughly a half would consider pneumonectomy after induction chemotherapy, but less than a quarter would consider pneumonectomy 
after chemoradiation.
Approximately three-fourths would give adjuvant RT for positive residual N2 disease, but only approximately one-fourth would give RT for  
N2 pathologic complete response.

NSCL-C 3 of 11
• Early-Stage NSCLC
Bullet 1:  
SABR (also known as SBRT) is recommended for patients who are medically inoperable or who refuse to have surgery after thoracic 
surgery evaluation. SABR has achieved good primary tumor control rates and overall survival, and higher than conventionally fractionated 
radiotherapy, although not proven equivalent to lobectomy.

SABR (also known as SBRT) has achieved good primary tumor control rates and overall survival, higher than conventionally fractionated 
radiotherapy. Although SABR is not proven equivalent to lobectomy, some prospective series have demonstrated similar overall and 
cancer-specific survival.
Bullet 5 added: Close follow-up and salvage therapy for isolated local and/or locoregional recurrence after SABR have been shown to 
improve overall survival in a large retrospective study.
NSCL-C 4 of 11 
• Conventionally Fractionated RT for Locally Advanced NSCLC
Bullet 2; sub-bullet 1; last sentence modified: A meta-analysis demonstrated improved survival with accelerated fractionation RT regimens, 
and individualized accelerated RT dose intensification is now being analyzed in a randomized trial (RTOG 1106) and RTOG 1106 found that 
PET-based individualized accelerated RT dose intensification potentially improved local control but not overall survival.
NSCL-C 5 of 11
• Advanced/Metastatic NSCLC (Stage IV)
Bullet 2: definitive changed to definitive/consolidative
Bullet 6 added: A pooled analysis of two randomized trials indicated that adding radiotherapy to a certain immune checkpoint inhibitor 
(anti-PD-1) significantly increased responses and clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Larger phase III 
randomized studies are ongoing.

NSCL-H 1 of 7
• Bullet 3: Tissue Specimen Acquisition and Management
Sub-bullet 2 modified: A major limitation in obtaining tissue molecular testing results for NSCLC occurs when minimally invasive 
techniques are used to obtain samples.
Sub-bullet 3 modified: When tissue is minimal, laboratories should deploy techniques to maximize tissue for molecular and ancillary 
testing, including dedicated histology protocols for small biopsies, including “up-front” slide sectioning for diagnostic and predictive 
testing. Peripheral blood (plasma circulating tumor DNA) can be a surrogate sample (NSCL-H 7 of 7).
NSCL-H 2 of 7
• Testing Methodologies
New entry under diamond 2: Broad molecular profiling is defined as molecular testing that identifies all biomarkers identified in NSCL-19 
in either a single assay or a combination of a limited number of assays, and optimally also identifies emerging biomarkers (NSCL-I). Tiered 
approaches based on low prevalence of co-occurring biomarkers are acceptable.
Diamond 5 added: Any method that interrogates sequences other than a subset of highly specific alterations (eg, NGS, Sanger) has the 
potential to identify variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Any variant classified as a VUS, even if in a gene in which other variants are 
clinically actionable, should not be considered as a basis for targeted therapy selection.
Diamond removed: IHC is specifically utilized for some specific analytes, and can be a useful surrogate or screening assay for others. 
NSCL-H 3 of 7
• Bullet 1: Molecular Targets for Analysis
Sub-bullet 2: EGFR Gene Mutations
 ◊ Diamond 2 updated: Molecular testing for EGFR mutations to should be performed when adjuvant TKI therapy is a consideration for 
NSCLC stage IB-IIIA. While the testing process may be technically easier on a resected specimen, initial diagnostic biopsy specimens are 
also acceptable for testing for this indication. on diagnostic biopsy or surgical resection sample to ensure the EGFR mutation results are 
available for adjuvant treatment decisions for patients with stage IIB-IIIA or high risk stage IB-IIA NSCLC.
 ◊ Diamond 3 modified: Many of the less commonly observed alterations in EGFR, which cumulatively account for ~10% of EGFR-mutation 
positive NSCLC (ie, exon 19 insertions, p.L861Q, p.G719X, p.S768I) are also associated with responsiveness to certain EGFR TKIs 
therapy, such as osimertinib and afatinib, and should be considered on a mutation-specific basis, when possible although the number of 
studied patients is lower.

UPDATES
Updates in Version 1.2022 of the NCCN Guidelines for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer from Version 7.2021 include:
NSCL-H 3 of 7
• Bullet 1: Molecular Targets for Analysis
Sub-bullet 2: EGFR Gene Mutations
 ◊ Diamond 4; entry modified: If EGFR p.T790M is observed identified in the absence of prior EGFR TKI therapy, genetic counseling and 
possible germline genetic testing are warranted. Identification of germline EGFR p.T790M confers a high risk for lung cancer regardless 
of smoking status.
 ◊ Diamond 5 modified: EGFR exon 20 (EGFRex20) mutations (other than EGFR p.T790M) are a heterogeneous group, some of which are 
responsive to targeted therapy and that require detailed knowledge of the specific alteration.
 – Sub-bullet 1 modified: These are generally associated with lack of response to first-, second-, and third-generation EGFR TKI 
therapy, with select exceptions: p.A763_Y764insFQEA is associated with sensitivity to TKI therapy and p.A763_Y764insLQEA may be 
associated with sensitivity to first- and third-generation TKI therapy.
 – Sub-bullet 2 added: EGFRex20 insertions/duplications are associated with responsiveness to specific targeted subsequent therapy 
agents. The most commonly represented EGFRex20 insertions/duplications in the clinical studies have been insASV, insSVD, and 
insNPH, although a wide spectrum of other alterations were included. There is currently no evidence that the specific alteration type 
impacts the probability of responsiveness to this class of kinase inhibitor.
 – Sub-bullet 3 modified: Because some EGFRex20 mutations are or may be sensitive to first- and third-generation inhibitors, For this 
reason, the specific sequence of EGFRex20 insertion mutations isremains important., and Some assays will identify the presence of an 
EGFRex20 insertion without specifying the sequence. In this scenario, and additional testing to further clarify the EGFRex20 insertion 
ismay be indicated for therapy selection.
 – Sub-bullet 4 added: Targeted PCR-based approaches for detection of EGFR variants may under-detect EGFRex20 insertion events; 
therefore, NGS-based strategies are preferred.
 ◊ Diamond removed, as content added to NSCL-H 2 of 7: As use of NGS testing increases, additional EGFR variants are increasingly 
identified; however, the clinical implications of individual alterations are unlikely to be well established.
NSCL-H 5 of 7
• Bullet 1: Molecular Targets for Analysis
Sub-bullet 1: KRAS point mutations
 ◊ Diamond 5 added: The presence of KRAS p.G12C is associated with responsiveness to an oral KRAS G12C inhibitor used for subsequent 
therapy, which was designed specifically for this mutation. Responsiveness to this class of inhibitor has not been prospectively 
evaluated with mutations other than KRAS p.G12C.
 ◊ Diamond 6 added: Testing methodologies: NGS, real-time PCR, and Sanger sequencing (ideally paired with tumor enrichment) are the 
most commonly deployed methodologies for examining KRAS mutation status.
Sub-bullet 2: MET exon 14 skipping variants
 ◊ Diamond 3 modified: Testing Methodologies: NGS-based testing is the primary method for detection of METex14 skipping events; RNA-
based NGS may have improved demonstrating improvement in detection.

Updates in Version 1.2022 of the NCCN Guidelines for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer from Version 7.2021 include:
NSCL-H 6 of 7
• Bullet 1: Molecular Targets for Analysis
Sub-bullet 1: NTRK1/2/3 gene fusions
 ◊ Diamond 1 added: The presence of NTRK1/2/3 gene fusions is associated with responsiveness to oral TRK inhibitors.
• Bullet 3: Testing in the Setting of Progression on Targeted Therapy
Diamond 3 added: Broad genomic profiling may be the most informative approach to examining potential mechanisms of resistance, which 
may require more than one instance of such profiling over the course of an individual patient’s therapy.
• Bullet 4 added: Testing in the setting of a limited number of pulmonary nodules can aid in distinguishing separate primary lung carcinoma 
versus intrapulmonary metastatic disease.
Sub-bullet 1 added: Studies to explore tumor relatedness by testing tissue from separately sampled lesions using a broad gene coverage 
NGS approach suggest it may be superior to histopathologic assessment. 
Sub-bullet 2 added: Tumor pairs exhibiting entirely non-overlapping, unique mutations are considered clonally unrelated separate primary 
lung cancers, even if histologically similar. Tumors that share multiple (≥2) mutations are more likely to be clonally related; however, this 
may depend on the extent to which any individual mutation is extremely common in NSCLC and whether identified alterations are driver or 
passenger alterations. Results in which no mutations or only one mutation are identified are not informative for this evaluation.
NSCL-H 7 of 7
• PD-L1
Diamond one modified: Various antibody clones have been developed for IHC analysis of PD-L1 expression, and while several show 
relative equivalence, are comparable regarding intensity and proportion of cells stained, some doare not.
Diamond one; entry removed: The FDA-approved companion diagnostic for PD-L1 guides utilization of pembrolizumab in patients with 
NSCLC and is based on the tumor proportion score (TPS). TPS is the percentage of viable tumor cells showing partial or complete 
membrane staining at any intensity.
Diamond one; entry one modified: The definition of positive and negative testing is dependent on the individual antibody, clone, and 
platform deployed, which may be unique to each checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The potential for approval of multiple different assays for PD-
L1 has raised concern among both pathologists and oncologists.
Diamond one; entry two added: While some clones for PD-L1 IHC are FDA-approved for specific indications, use of multiple IHC tests is not 
necessary, provided any individual IHC test has been internally validated for comparability for categorical results against the FDA-approved 
clone. 
• Plasma Cell-Free/Circulating Tumor DNA Testing
Sub-bullet 3 modified: Studies have demonstrated cell-free tumor DNA testing to generally have very high specificity, but significantly 
compromised sensitivity, with up to a 30% false-negative rate; however, data support complementary testing to reduce turnaround time and 
increase yield of targetable alteration detection.
Sub-bullet 4 modified: Published guidelines elaborating standards for analytical performance characteristics of cell-free tumor DNA have 
not been established, and in contrast to tissue-based testing, no guidelines exist regarding the recommended performance characteristics 
of this type of testing.
Sub-bullet 6; Diamond 3 added: In the initial diagnostic setting, if tissue-based testing does not completely assess all recommended 
biomarkers owing to tissue quantity or testing methodologies available, consider repeat biopsy and/or cell-free/circulating tumor DNA 
testing.

• Footnote d modified: Contraindications for treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors may include active or previously documented autoimmune 
disease and/or current use of immunosuppressive agents, or presence of an oncogene (eg,ie, EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R, ALK 
rearrangements, RET rearrangements), which would predict lack of benefit. (also applies to NSCL-K 2 of 5)

expression, in EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R, ALK+ NSCLC.
ST-3
• Footnote ** added: The staging of tumor size in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition is based on the total tumor size (invasive and 
lepidic/noninvasive); whereas, in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 8th Edition, staging is based on invasive size only for non-mucinous 
adenocarcinoma. However, in mucinous adenocarcinoma, the total tumor size is used.

PREV-1
LUNG CANCER PREVENTION AND SCREENING
• Lung cancer is a unique disease in that the major etiologic agent is an addictive product that is made and promoted by an industry. 
Approximately 85% to 90% of cases are caused by voluntary or involuntary (second-hand) cigarette smoking. Reduction of lung cancer 
mortality will require effective public health policies to prevent initiation of smoking, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversight of 
tobacco products, and other tobacco control measures.
• Persistent smoking is associated with second primary cancers, treatment complications, drug interactions, other tobacco-related medical 
conditions, diminished quality of life, and reduced survival. 
• Reports from the Surgeon General on both active smoking (http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/2004/pdfs/executivesummary.pdf)  
and second-hand smoke show that both cause lung cancer. The evidence shows a 20% to 30% increase in the risk for lung cancer from  
second-hand smoke exposure associated with living with a smoker (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK44324/).  
Every person should be informed of the health consequences, addictive nature, and mortal threat posed by tobacco consumption and 
exposure to tobacco smoke, and effective legislative, executive, administrative, or other measures should be contemplated at the appropriate 
governmental level to protect all persons from exposure to tobacco smoke.
• Further complicating this problem, the delivery system of lung carcinogens also contains the highly addictive substance, nicotine. 
Reduction of lung cancer mortality will require widespread implementation of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) 
Guidelines (http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/clinicians-providers/guidelines-recommendations/tobacco/index.html) to identify, counsel, 
and treat patients with nicotine habituation.
• Patients who are current or former smokers have significant risk for the development of lung cancer; chemoprevention agents are not yet 
established for these patients. When possible, these patients should be encouraged to enroll in chemoprevention trials.
• Lung cancer screening using low-dose CT (LDCT) is recommended in select high-risk smokers and former smokers (see the NCCN 
Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening).
• See the NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation.

PRINCIPLES OF DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION
• Patients with a strong clinical suspicion of stage I or II lung cancer (based on risk factors and radiologic appearance) do not require a biopsy 
before surgery.
A biopsy adds time, costs, and procedural risk and may not be needed for treatment decisions.
A preoperative biopsy may be appropriate if a non-lung cancer diagnosis is strongly suspected that can be diagnosed by core biopsy or 
fine-needle aspiration (FNA).
A preoperative biopsy may be appropriate if an intraoperative diagnosis appears difficult or very risky.1
If a preoperative tissue diagnosis has not been obtained, then an intraoperative diagnosis (ie, wedge resection, needle biopsy) is necessary 
before lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy.1
• Bronchoscopy should preferably be performed during the planned surgical resection, rather than as a separate procedure.
Bronchoscopy is required before surgical resection (NSCL-2).
A separate bronchoscopy may not be needed for treatment decisions before the time of surgery and adds time, costs, and procedural risk.
A preoperative bronchoscopy may be appropriate if a central tumor requires pre-resection evaluation for biopsy, surgical planning (eg, 
potential sleeve resection), or preoperative airway preparation (eg, coring out an obstructive lesion).
• Invasive mediastinal staging is recommended before surgical resection for most patients with clinical stage I or II lung cancer (NSCL-2).
Patients should preferably undergo invasive mediastinal staging (mediastinoscopy) as the initial step before the planned resection 
(during the same anesthetic procedure), rather than as a separate procedure. For patients undergoing endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)/ 
endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) staging, this may require a separate procedure to allow evaluation if onsite rapid cytology interpretation is 
not available.
A separate staging procedure adds time, costs, coordination of care, inconvenience, and an additional anesthetic risk.
Preoperative invasive mediastinal staging may be appropriate for a strong clinical suspicion of N2 or N3 nodal disease or when 
intraoperative cytology or frozen section analysis is not available.
1 Patients require tissue confirmation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) before a lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy. If a preoperative or intraoperative 
tissue diagnosis appears risky or unreliable, multidisciplinary evaluation that at least includes interventional radiology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology 
is recommended to determine the safest and most efficient approach for biopsy, or to provide consensus that a biopsy is too risky or difficult and that the patient can 
proceed with anatomic resection without tissue confirmation.

• In patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), many techniques are available for tissue diagnosis. 
Diagnostic tools that should be routinely available include:
 ◊ Sputum cytology
 ◊ Bronchoscopy with biopsy and transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA)
 ◊ Image-guided transthoracic needle core biopsy (preferred) or FNA 
 ◊ Thoracentesis
 ◊ Mediastinoscopy
 ◊ Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and open surgical biopsy
Diagnostic tools that provide important additional strategies for biopsy include:
 ◊ EBUS–guided biopsy 
 ◊ EUS–guided biopsy
 ◊ Navigational bronchoscopy
 ◊ Robotic bronchoscopy
• The preferred diagnostic strategy for an individual patient depends on the size and location of the tumor, the presence of mediastinal or 
distant disease, patient characteristics (such as pulmonary pathology and/or other significant comorbidities), and local experience and 
expertise. 
Factors to be considered in choosing the optimal diagnostic step include:
 ◊ Anticipated diagnostic yield (sensitivity)
 ◊ Diagnostic accuracy including specificity and particularly the reliability of a negative diagnostic study (ie, true negative)
 ◊ Adequate volume of tissue specimen for diagnosis and molecular testing
 ◊ Invasiveness and risk of procedure
 ◊ Efficiency of evaluation
 – Access and timeliness of procedure
 – Concomitant staging is beneficial, because it avoids additional biopsies or procedures. It is preferable to biopsy the pathology that 
would confer the highest stage (ie, to biopsy a suspected metastasis or mediastinal lymph node rather than the pulmonary lesion). 
Therefore, PET/CT imaging is frequently best performed before a diagnostic biopsy site is chosen in cases of high clinical suspicion 
for aggressive, advanced-stage tumors.
 ◊ Technologies and expertise available
 ◊ Tumor viability at proposed biopsy site from PET/CT imaging
Decisions about the optimal diagnostic steps for suspected stage I to III lung cancer should be made by thoracic radiologists, 
interventional radiologists, and thoracic surgeons who devote a significant portion of their practice to thoracic oncology. Multidisciplinary 
evaluation should also include a pulmonologist or thoracic surgeon with expertise in advanced bronchoscopic techniques for diagnosis.

 ◊ Patients with central masses and suspected endobronchial involvement should undergo bronchoscopy.
 ◊ Patients with peripheral (outer one-third) nodules may benefit from navigational bronchoscopy, radial EBUS, or transthoracic needle 
aspiration (TTNA).
 ◊ Patients with suspected nodal disease should be biopsied by EBUS, EUS, navigational bronchoscopy, or mediastinoscopy.
 – EBUS provides access to nodal stations 2R/2L, 4R/4L, 7, 10R/10L, and other hilar nodal stations if necessary.
 – An EBUS-TBNA negative for malignancy in a clinically (PET and/or CT) positive mediastinum should undergo subsequent 
mediastinoscopy prior to surgical resection.
 – EUS–guided biopsy provides additional access to stations 5, 7, 8, and 9 lymph nodes if these are clinically suspicious.
 – TTNA and anterior mediastinotomy (ie, Chamberlain procedure) provide additional access to anterior mediastinal (stations 5 and 6) 
lymph nodes if these are clinically suspicious. If TTNA is not possible due to proximity to aorta, VATS biopsy is also an option. 
 ◊ EUS also provides reliable access to the left adrenal gland.
 ◊ Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE), when available, helps to increase diagnostic and molecular yield. 
 ◊ Lung cancer patients with an associated pleural effusion should undergo thoracentesis and cytology. A negative cytology result on  
initial thoracentesis does not exclude pleural involvement. An additional thoracentesis and/or thoracoscopic evaluation of the pleura 
should be considered before starting curative intent therapy.
 ◊ Patients suspected of having a solitary site of metastatic disease should have tissue confirmation of that site if feasible.
 ◊ Patients suspected of having metastatic disease should have confirmation from one of the metastatic sites if feasible.
 ◊ Patients who may have multiple sites of metastatic disease—based on a strong clinical suspicion—should have biopsy of the primary 
lung lesion or mediastinal lymph nodes if it is technically difficult or very risky to biopsy a metastatic site.

h Methods for evaluation include mediastinoscopy, mediastinotomy, EBUS, 
EUS, and CT-guided biopsy. An EBUS-TBNA negative for malignancy in a 
clinically (PET and/or CT) positive mediastinum should undergo subsequent 
mediastinoscopy prior to surgical resection.
i There is low likelihood of positive mediastinal lymph nodes when these nodes are 
CT and PET negative in solid tumors <1 cm and purely non-solid tumors <3 cm. 
Thus, pre-resection pathologic mediastinal evaluation is optional in these settings.
j PET/CT performed skull base to knees or whole body. Positive PET/CT scan 
findings for distant disease need pathologic or other radiologic confirmation. If 
PET/CT scan is positive in the mediastinum, lymph node status needs pathologic 
confirmation.

definitive RT. Principles of Image-Guided Thermal Ablation Therapy (NSCL-D).
n If empiric therapy is contemplated without tissue confirmation, multidisciplinary 
evaluation that at least includes interventional radiology, thoracic surgery, and 
interventional pulmonology is required to determine the safest and most efficient 
approach for biopsy, or to provide consensus that a biopsy is too risky or difficult

h Methods for evaluation include mediastinoscopy, mediastinotomy, EBUS, 
EUS, and CT-guided biopsy. An EBUS-TBNA negative for malignancy in a 
clinically (PET and/or CT) positive mediastinum should undergo subsequent 
mediastinoscopy prior to surgical resection. 
j PET/CT performed skull base to knees or whole body. Positive PET/CT scan 
findings for distant disease need pathologic or other radiologic confirmation. If 
PET/CT scan is positive in the mediastinum, lymph node status needs pathologic 
confirmation.
k Principles of Surgical Therapy (NSCL-B).
l Principles of Radiation Therapy (NSCL-C).
o If MRI is not possible, CT of head with contrast.
p After surgical evaluation, patients likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy may be

v R0 = no residual tumor, R1 = microscopic residual tumor, R2 = macroscopic 
residual tumor.
bb Lesions with different cell types (eg, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma) 
are usually different primary tumors. This analysis may be limited by small biopsy 
samples. However, lesions of the same cell type are not necessarily metastases. 
Single contralateral lung nodules with clinical, radiologic, or pathologic features 
suggestive of a synchronous primary lung cancer (eg, long disease-free survival, 
ground glass components, different histologic characteristics) that are amenable 
to local therapy should be considered as probable separate primary cancers and 
eligible for local therapy (NSCL-11). Multiple studies suggest that next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) testing with broad gene coverage may allow for unambiguous 
determination of clonal relatedness among separate lung nodules. 
cc For guidance regarding the evaluation, workup, and management of subsolid 
pulmonary nodules, please see the diagnostic evaluation of a nodule suspicious 
for lung cancer (DIAG-1).

ff Most pleural (pericardial) effusions with lung cancer are a result of the tumor. In a 
few patients, however, multiple microscopic examinations of pleural (pericardial) 
fluid are negative for tumor, and fluid is non-bloody and not an exudate. If these 
elements and clinical judgment dictate that the effusion is not related to the tumor, 
the effusion should be excluded as a staging descriptor.

o If MRI is not possible, CT of head with contrast.
jj Timing of CT scans within Guidelines parameters is a clinical decision.
kk FDG PET/CT is currently not warranted in the routine surveillance and follow-up of patients with NSCLC. However, many benign conditions (such as atelectasis, 
consolidation, and radiation fibrosis) are difficult to differentiate from neoplasm on standard CT imaging, and FDG PET/CT can be used to differentiate true malignancy 
in these settings. However, if FDG PET/CT is to be used as a problem-solving tool in patients after radiation therapy, histopathologic confirmation of recurrent disease 
is needed because areas previously treated with radiation therapy can remain FDG avid for up to 2 years.

mm Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis (NSCL-H).
nn The NCCN NSCLC Guidelines Panel strongly advises broader molecular 
profiling with the goal of identifying rare driver mutations for which effective 
drugs may already be available, or to appropriately counsel patients regarding 
the availability of clinical trials. Broad molecular profiling is defined as molecular 
testing that identifies all biomarkers identified in NSCL-19 in either a single assay 
or a combination of a limited number of assays, and optimally also identifies 
emerging biomarkers (NSCL-I). Tiered approaches based on low prevalence 
of co-occurring biomarkers are acceptable. Broad molecular profiling is a key 
component of the improvement of care of patients with NSCLC. Emerging 
Biomarkers to Identify Patients for Therapies (NSCL-I).

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC REVIEW
• Pathologic Evaluation
The purpose of the pathologic evaluation of NSCLC will vary depending on whether the sample 1) is a biopsy or cytology specimen 
intended for initial diagnosis in a case of suspected NSCLC; 2) is a resection specimen; or 3) is obtained for molecular evaluation in the 
setting of an established NSCLC diagnosis.
 ◊ In small biopsies or cytology specimens intended for initial diagnosis, the primary purpose is a) to make an accurate diagnosis using the 
2015 WHO classification; and b) to preserve the tissue for molecular studies, especially if the patient has advanced-stage disease.
 ◊ In small biopsies of poorly differentiated carcinomas, the terms "non-small cell carcinoma (NSCC)1" or "non-small cell carcinoma not 
otherwise specified (NSCC-NOS)" should be used as little as possible and only when a more specific diagnosis is not possible by 
morphology and/or special staining.
 ◊ The following terms are acceptable: "NSCC favor adenocarcinoma" and "NSCC favor squamous cell carcinoma." "NSCC-NOS" should be 
reserved only for cases in which immunohistochemical testing is uninformative or ambiguous (see section on Immunohistochemistry).
 ◊ Preservation of material for molecular testing is critical. Efforts should be undertaken to minimize block reorientation and the number of  
(IHC) stains for cases that cannot be classified on histologic examination alone (see section on Immunohistochemistry).
In resection specimens, the primary purpose is a) to classify the histologic type; and b) to determine all staging parameters, as 
recommended by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), including tumor size, extent of invasion, adequacy of surgical margins, 
and presence or absence of lymph node metastases.
 ◊ The number of involved lymph node stations should be documented since it has prognostic significance (AJCC 8th ed). Direct extension 
of the primary tumor into an adjacent lymph node is considered as nodal involvement.
 ◊ All lobectomy specimens should be extensively dissected to search for involved lymph nodes.  
In small biopsies or cytology specimens—obtained for molecular testing in the context of an established diagnosis after progression on 
targeted therapies, the primary purpose is a) to confirm the original pathologic type with minimal use of tissue for IHC only in suspected 
small cell carcinoma transformation or a different histology; and b) to preserve material for molecular analysis.
• Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material is suitable for most molecular analyses, except bone biopsies that were previously treated 
with acid decalcifying solutions. Non-acid decalcification approaches may be successful for subsequent molecular testing. While many 
molecular pathology laboratories currently also accept cytopathology specimens such as cell blocks, direct smears, or touch preparations, 
laboratories that do not currently do so are strongly encouraged to identify approaches to testing on non-FFPE cytopathology specimens.
1 Non-small cell carcinomas (NSCC, without the L for lung) that show no clear adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma morphology or immunohistochemical 
markers are regarded as NSCC-NOS. In this setting, it is recommended that pathologists use the term NSCC rather than NSCLC, because the lack of pneumocyte 
marker expression in small biopsies or cytology leaves open the possibility of a metastatic carcinoma and the determination of a lung primary must be established 
clinically after excluding other primary sites.

NSCLC Classification
• The types of NSCLC are: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and sarcomatoid 
carcinoma.
Squamous cell carcinoma: A malignant epithelial tumor that either shows keratinization and/or intercellular bridges, or a morphologically 
undifferentiated NSCC that expresses immunohistochemical markers of squamous cell differentiation. 
Adenocarcinoma: 
 ◊ For small (<3 cm), resected lesions, determining extent of invasion is critical.
 – Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS; formerly BAC): A small (≤3 cm) localized nodule with lepidic growth, mostly non-mucinous, although 
mucinous types can occur. Multiple synchronous AIS tumors can also occur.
 – Minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA): A small (≤3 cm) solitary adenocarcinoma with a predominantly lepidic pattern and ≤5 mm 
invasion in greatest dimension. MIA is usually non-mucinous, but rarely may be mucinous. MIA is, by definition, solitary and discrete.  
 – Invasive adenocarcinoma: A malignant epithelial tumor with glandular differentiation, mucin production, or pneumocyte marker 
expression. The tumors show an acinar, papillary, micropapillary, lepidic, or solid growth pattern, with either mucin or pneumocyte 
marker expression. The invasive adenocarcinoma component should be present in at least one focus measuring >5 mm in greatest 
dimension. 
 – Invasive adenocarcinoma variants: invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, colloid adenocarcinoma, fetal adenocarcinoma, and enteric 
adenocarcinoma.
 – Refer to College of American Pathologists Protocols for additional information.
Adenosquamous carcinoma: A carcinoma showing components of both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, with each 
component constituting at least 10% of the tumor. Definitive diagnosis requires a resection specimen, although it may be suggested based 
on findings in small biopsies, cytology, or excisional biopsies. Presence of any adenocarcinoma component in a biopsy specimen that is 
otherwise squamous should trigger molecular testing.
Large cell carcinoma: Undifferentiated NSCC that lacks the cytologic, architectural, and histochemical features of small cell carcinoma, 
adenocarcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma. The diagnosis requires a thoroughly sampled resected tumor and cannot be made on non-
resection or cytology specimens.
Sarcomatoid carcinoma is a general term that includes pleomorphic carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, and pulmonary blastoma. For this reason, 
it is best to use the specific term for these entities whenever possible rather than the general term. 
 ◊ Pleomorphic carcinoma is a poorly differentiated NSCC that contains at least 10% spindle and/or giant cells or a carcinoma consisting 
only of spindle and giant cells. Spindle cell carcinoma consists of an almost pure population of epithelial spindle cells, while Giant cell 
carcinoma consists almost entirely of tumor giant cells.
 ◊ Carcinosarcoma is a malignant tumor that consists of a mixture of NSCC and sarcoma-containing heterologous elements (eg, 
rhabdomyosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma).
 ◊ Pulmonary blastoma is a biphasic tumor that consists of fetal adenocarcinoma (typically low grade) and primitive mesenchymal stroma.

Immunohistochemistry
• Judicious use of IHC is strongly recommended to preserve tissue for molecular testing, most notably in small specimens. When 
adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinomas are poorly differentiated, the defining morphologic criteria that would allow for specific 
diagnosis may be inconspicuous or absent. In this case, IHC or mucin staining may be necessary to determine a specific diagnosis.
• In small specimens, a limited number of immunostains with one lung adenocarcinoma marker (TTF1, napsin A) and one squamous 
carcinoma marker (p40, p63) should suffice for most diagnostic problems. Virtually all tumors that lack squamous cell morphology and show 
co-expression of p63 and TTF1 are preferably classified as adenocarcinoma. A simple panel of TTF1 and p40 may be sufficient to classify 
most NSCC-NOS cases. 
•  Testing for NUT expression by IHC should be considered in all poorly differentiated carcinomas that lack glandular differentiation or specific 
etiology, particularly in non-smokers or in patients presenting at a young age, for consideration of a pulmonary NUT carcinoma. 
• IHC should be used to differentiate primary lung adenocarcinoma from squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, metastatic 
carcinoma, and primary pleural mesothelioma (particularly for pleural specimens).
• Primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma:
In patients for whom the primary origin of the carcinoma is uncertain, an appropriate panel of immunohistochemical stains is 
recommended to assess for metastatic carcinoma to the lung.
TTF1 is a homeodomain-containing nuclear transcription protein of the NKX2 gene family that is expressed in epithelial cells of the 
embryonal and mature lung and thyroid. TTF1 immunoreactivity is seen in primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma in the majority (70%–90%) 
of non-mucinous adenocarcinoma subtypes. Metastatic adenocarcinoma to the lung is nearly always negative for TTF1 except in metastatic 
thyroid malignancies, in which case thyroglobulin and PAX8 are also positive. Rare cases of TTF1 positivity in tumors of other organs 
(gynecologic tract, pancreatobiliary) have been noted, and may be dependent on the specific TTF1 clone utilized, stressing the importance 
of correlation with clinical and radiologic features.
Napsin A—an aspartic proteinase expressed in normal type II pneumocytes and in proximal and distal renal tubules—appears to be 
expressed in >80% of lung adenocarcinomas and may be a useful adjunct to TTF1.
The panel of TTF1 (or alternatively napsin A) and p40 (or alternatively p63) may be useful in refining the diagnosis to either adenocarcinoma 
or squamous cell carcinoma in small biopsy specimens previously classified as NSCC NOS.

Immunohistochemistry
• IHC should be used to confirm neuroendocrine differentiation when there is morphologic evidence of neuroendocrine morphology (eg, 
speckled chromatin pattern, nuclear molding, peripheral palisading):
NCAM (CD56), chromogranin, synaptophysin, and INSM1 are used to identify neuroendocrine tumors in cases in which morphologic 
suspicion of neuroendocrine differentiation exists. 
A panel of markers is useful, but one positive marker is enough if the staining is unambiguous in more than 10% of the tumor cells. 
• Malignant mesothelioma versus pulmonary adenocarcinoma
The distinction between pulmonary adenocarcinoma and malignant mesothelioma (epithelioid type) can be made by correlation of the 
histology with the clinical impression, imaging studies, and a panel of immunomarkers.
Immunostains sensitive and specific for mesothelioma include WT-1, calretinin, CK5/6, and D2-40 (usually negative in adenocarcinoma).   
Immunostains sensitive and specific for adenocarcinoma include pCEA, Claudin 4, TTF1, and napsin A (negative in mesothelioma). Other 
potentially useful markers that can be considered include B72.3, Ber-EP4, MOC31, and CD15, but these generally do not have the sensitivity 
and specificity of the above markers. 
A pancytokeratin such as AE1/AE3 is also useful, as a negative result suggests the possibility of other tumors.
Other markers can be helpful in the differential diagnosis between mesothelioma and metastatic carcinoma, and will also help determine 
the tumor origin. Examples include markers for lung adenocarcinoma (TTF1 and napsin A), breast carcinoma (ERα, PR, GCDFP15, 
mammaglobin, and GATA-3), renal cell carcinoma (PAX8), papillary serous carcinoma (PAX8, PAX2, and ER), adenocarcinomas of 
the gastrointestinal tract (CDX2), and prostate cancer (NKX3.1). Additionally, p40 (or p63) is helpful for distinguishing epithelioid 
mesotheliomas with pseudosquamous morphology from squamous cell carcinomas.

a Peripheral is defined as the outer one third of the lung parenchyma.
Margins and Nodal Assessment (see NSCL-B 2 of 4) The Role of Surgery in Patients with Stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC 
(see NSCL-B 2 of 4 through NSCL-B 4 of 4)
Evaluation
• Determination of resectability, surgical staging, and pulmonary resection should be performed by thoracic surgeons who perform lung 
cancer surgery as a prominent part of their practice. 
• CT and PET/CT used for staging should be within 60 days before proceeding with surgical evaluation.
• For medically operable disease, resection is the preferred local treatment modality (other modalities include SABR, thermal ablation such 
as radiofrequency ablation, and cryotherapy). Thoracic surgical oncology consultation should be part of the evaluation of any patient being 
considered for curative local therapy. In cases where SABR is considered for high-risk or borderline operable patients, a multidisciplinary 
evaluation including a radiation oncologist is recommended.
• The overall plan of treatment as well as needed imaging studies should be determined before any non-emergency treatment is initiated.
• Thoracic surgeons should actively participate in multidisciplinary discussions and meetings regarding lung cancer patients (eg, 
multidisciplinary clinic and/or tumor board).
• Patients who are active smokers should be provided counseling and smoking cessation support (NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation). 
While active smokers have a mildly increased incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications, these should not be considered 
a prohibitive risk for surgery. Surgeons should not deny surgery to patients solely due to smoking status, as surgery provides the 
predominant therapy for patients with early-stage lung cancer.
Resection
• Anatomic pulmonary resection is preferred for the majority of patients with NSCLC.
• Sublobar resection - Segmentectomy and wedge resection should achieve parenchymal resection margins ≥2 cm or ≥ the size of the nodule.
• Sublobar resection should also sample appropriate N1 and N2 lymph node stations unless not technically feasible without substantially 
increasing the surgical risk. 
• Segmentectomy (preferred) or wedge resection is appropriate in selected patients for the following reasons:
Poor pulmonary reserve or other major comorbidity that contraindicates lobectomy
Peripheral nodulea ≤2 cm with at least one of the following:
 ◊ Pure AIS histology
 ◊ Nodule has ≥50% ground-glass appearance on CT
 ◊ Radiologic surveillance confirms a long doubling time (≥400 days)
• VATS or minimally invasive surgery (including robotic-assisted approaches) should be strongly considered for patients with no anatomic or 
surgical contraindications, as long as there is no compromise of standard oncologic and dissection principles of thoracic surgery.
• In high-volume centers with significant VATS experience, VATS lobectomy in selected patients results in improved early outcomes (ie, 
decreased pain, reduced hospital length of stay, more rapid return to function, fewer complications) without compromise of cancer 
outcomes.
• Lung-sparing anatomic resection (sleeve lobectomy) is preferred over pneumonectomy, if anatomically appropriate and margin-negative 
resection is achieved.
• T3 (invasion) and T4 local extension tumors require en-bloc resection of the involved structure with negative margins. If a surgeon or center 
is uncertain about potential complete resection, consider obtaining an additional surgical opinion from a high-volume specialized center.

Margins and Nodal Assessment
• Surgical pathologic correlation is critical to assess apparent close or positive margins, as these may not represent true margins or may not 
truly represent areas of risk for local recurrence (eg, medial surface of mainstem or bronchus intermedius when separate subcarinal lymph 
node dissection has been performed; pleural margin adjacent to aorta when no attachment to aorta is present).
• N1 and N2 node resection and mapping should be a routine component of lung cancer resections—a minimum of three N2 stations sampled 
or complete lymph node dissection.
• Formal ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node dissection is indicated for patients undergoing resection for stage IIIA (N2) disease.
• Complete resection requires free resection margins, systematic node dissection or sampling, and the highest mediastinal node negative 
for tumor. The resection is defined as incomplete whenever there is involvement of resection margins, unremoved positive lymph nodes, 
or positive pleural or pericardial effusions. A complete resection is referred to as R0, microscopically positive resection as R1, and 
macroscopic residual tumor as R2.
• Patients with pathologic stage II or greater, or high-risk factors, should be referred to medical oncology for evaluation.
• Consider referral to a radiation oncologist for resected stage IIIA. 
The Role of Surgery in Patients with Stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC
The role of surgery in patients with pathologically documented N2 disease remains controversial.1 Two randomized trials evaluated the role of 
surgery in this population, but neither showed an overall survival benefit with the use of surgery.2,3 However, this population is heterogeneous 
and the panel believes that these trials did not sufficiently evaluate the nuances present with the heterogeneity of N2 disease and the likely 
oncologic benefit of surgery in specific clinical situations.
• The presence or absence of N2 disease should be vigorously determined by both radiologic and invasive staging prior to the initiation of 
therapy since the presence of mediastinal nodal disease has a profound impact on prognosis and treatment decisions. (NSCL-1, NSCL-2, and 
NSCL-6)
• Patients with occult-positive N2 nodes discovered at the time of pulmonary resection should continue with the planned resection along 
with formal mediastinal lymph node dissection. If N2 disease is noted in patients undergoing VATS, the surgeon may consider stopping the 
procedure so that induction therapy can be administered before surgery; however, continuing the procedure is also an option.
• The determination of the role of surgery in a patient with N2-positive lymph nodes should be made prior to the initiation of any therapy by a 
multidisciplinary team, including a thoracic surgeon who has a major part of his/her practice dedicated to thoracic oncology.4
• The presence of N2-positive lymph nodes substantially increases the likelihood of positive N3 lymph nodes. Pathologic evaluation of the 
mediastinum must include evaluation of the subcarinal station and contralateral lymph nodes. EBUS +/- EUS are additional techniques for 
minimally invasive pathologic mediastinal staging that are complementary to mediastinoscopy. Even when these modalities are employed 
it is important to have an adequate evaluation of the number of stations involved and biopsy and documentation of negative contralateral 
lymph node involvement prior to a final treatment decision.

• Repeat mediastinoscopy, while possible, is technically difficult and has a lower accuracy compared to primary mediastinoscopy. One possible 
strategy is to perform EBUS (± EUS) in the initial pretreatment evaluation and reserve mediastinoscopy for nodal restaging after neoadjuvant 
therapy.5
• Patients with a single lymph node smaller than 3 cm can be considered for a multimodality approach that includes surgical resection.1,6,7
• Restaging after induction therapy is difficult to interpret, but CT ± PET should be performed to exclude disease progression or interval development 
of metastatic disease.
• Patients with negative mediastinum after neoadjuvant therapy have a better prognosis.7,8
• Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is used in one-third of the NCCN Member Institutions, while neoadjuvant chemotherapy is used in the other two-
thirds. Overall survival appears similar provided RT is given postoperatively, if not given preoperatively.5,9 Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is 
associated with higher rates of pathologic complete response and negative mediastinal lymph nodes.10 However, that is achieved at the expense of 
higher rates of acute toxicity and increased cost.
• When neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is used with doses lower than those used for standard definitive therapy, all efforts should be made to 
minimize any possible breaks in radiotherapy for surgical evaluation. Treatment breaks of more than 1 week are considered unacceptable.
• When timely surgical evaluation is not available, the strategy of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy should not be used. Another option in individual 
cases, and with the agreement of the thoracic surgeon, is to complete definitive chemoradiotherapy prior to re-evaluation and consideration for 
surgery.11,12 If a surgeon or center is uncertain about the feasibility or safety of resection after definitive doses of radiation, consider obtaining an 
additional surgical opinion from a high-volume specialized center. These operations may also benefit from additional considerations of soft tissue 
flap coverage in the radiation field at the time of resection.
• Data from a large multi-institutional trial indicate that pneumonectomy after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has unacceptable morbidity and 
mortality.2 However, it is not clear if this is also true with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. Further, many groups have challenged that cooperative 
group finding with single-institution experiences demonstrating safety of pneumonectomy after induction therapy.13-16 In addition, there is no 
evidence that adding RT to induction regimens for patients with operable stage IIIA (N2) disease improves outcomes compared to induction 
chemotherapy.17
A questionnaire was submitted to the NCCN Member Institutions in 2021 regarding their approach to patients with N2 disease. Their responses indicate the 
patterns of practice when approaching this difficult clinical problem. 
• All NCCN institutions treat select N2 patients with multimodality therapy that includes surgery.
• The majority of NCCN institutions prefer EBUS for initial mediastinal staging, reserving mediastinoscopy for possible restaging.
• The majority of institutions do not pathologically restage mediastinal lymph nodes after induction therapy and prior to surgery. 
• All NCCN institutions consider surgery for single-station non-bulky N2 disease.
• Approximately half of the institutions consider surgery for single-station bulky disease, 39% for multi-station non-bulky disease, and 21% for multi-station 
bulky disease.
• Two-thirds of institutions prefer induction chemotherapy; one-third prefer chemoradiation.
• The majority require at least stable disease after induction, but do not require radiologic or pathologic response prior to surgery.
• Roughly a half would consider pneumonectomy after induction chemotherapy, but less than a quarter would consider pneumonectomy after chemoradiation.
•  Approximately three-fourths would give adjuvant RT for positive residual N2 disease, but only approximately one-fourth would give RT for N2 pathologic 
complete response.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY
I. General Principles (see Table 1. Commonly Used Abbreviations in Radiation Therapy)
• Determination of the appropriateness of radiation therapy (RT) should be made by radiation oncologists who perform lung cancer RT as a 
prominent part of their practice. 
• RT has a potential role in all stages of NSCLC, as either definitive/consolidative or palliative therapy. Radiation oncology input as part of a 
multidisciplinary evaluation or discussion should be provided for all patients with stage III NSCLC, with early-stage disease who are medically 
inoperable, who refuse surgery, or who are high-risk surgical candidates, and with stage IV disease that may benefit from local therapy.
• The critical goals of modern RT are to maximize tumor control and to minimize treatment toxicity. A minimum technologic standard is CT-
planned 3D-CRT.1
• More advanced technologies are appropriate when needed to deliver curative RT safely. These technologies include (but are not limited to)  
4D-CT and/or PET/CT simulation, IMRT/VMAT, IGRT, motion management, and proton therapy (https://www.astro.org/Daily-Practice/
Reimbursement/Model-Policies/Model-Policies/). Nonrandomized comparisons of using advanced technologies demonstrate reduced toxicity 
and improved survival versus older techniques.2-4 In a prospective trial of definitive/consolidative chemo/RT for patients with stage III NSCLC 
(RTOG 0617), IMRT was associated with a nearly 60% decrease (from 7.9% to 3.5%) in high-grade radiation pneumonitis as well as similar 
survival and tumor control outcomes despite a higher proportion of stage IIIB and larger treatment volumes compared to 3D-CRT;5 as such, 
IMRT is preferred over 3D-CRT in this setting.
• Centers using advanced technologies should implement and document modality-specific quality assurance measures. The ideal is external 
credentialing of both treatment planning and delivery such as required for participation in RTOG clinical trials employing advanced 
technologies. Useful references include the ACR Practice Parameters and Technical Standards (https://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/
PGTS/toc.pdf).
• The interaction of strong VEGF inhibitors with prior or subsequent dose-intensive RT (SABR or definitive dose accelerated fractionation) 
involving the proximal bronchial tree, hilar vessels, or esophagus can lead to serious toxicity. Careful coordination of medical and radiation 
oncology on the therapeutic strategy is important, including the choice and sequencing of systemic agents with strong VEGF inhibitors and the 
dose and fractionation of radiation, especially for patients with metastatic disease.
II. Radiation Therapy Simulation, Planning, and Delivery
• Simulation should be performed using CT scans obtained in the RT treatment position with appropriate immobilization devices. IV contrast with 
or without oral contrast is recommended for better target/organ delineation whenever possible in patients with central tumors or nodal disease. 
Because IV contrast can affect tissue heterogeneity correction calculations, density masking or use of a pre-contrast scan may be needed when 
intense enhancement is present.
• PET/CT significantly improves targeting accuracy,6 especially for patients with significant atelectasis and when IV CT contrast is 
contraindicated. A randomized trial of PET/CT versus CT-only RT planning demonstrated improved preemption of futile radical RT, decreased 
recurrences, and a trend toward improved overall survival with PET/CT RT planning.7 Given the potential for rapid progression of NSCLC,8,9 
PET/CT should be obtained preferably within 4 weeks before treatment. It is ideal to obtain PET/CT in the treatment position.
• Tumor and organ motion, especially owing to breathing, should be assessed or accounted for at simulation. Options include fluoroscopy, 
inhale/exhale or slow scan CT, or, ideally, 4D-CT.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY
II. Radiation Therapy Simulation, Planning, and Delivery (continued)
• Photon beam energy should be individualized based on the anatomic location of the tumors and beam paths. In general, photon energies 
between 4 to 10 MV are recommended for beams passing through low-density lung tissue before entering the tumor. When there is no air 
gap before the beam enters the tumor (such as for some large mediastinal tumors or tumors attached to the chest wall), higher energies may 
improve the dose distribution, especially when using a smaller number of fixed beam angles.
• Tissue heterogeneity correction and accurate dose calculation algorithms are recommended that account for buildup and lateral electron 
scatter effects in heterogeneous density tissues. Heterogeneity correction with simple pencil beam algorithms is not recommended.10
• Respiratory motion should be managed when motion is excessive. This includes (but is not limited to) forced shallow breathing with 
abdominal compression, accelerator beam gating with the respiratory cycle, dynamic tumor tracking, active breathing control (ABC), or 
coaching/biofeedback techniques. If motion is minimal or the ITV is small, motion-encompassing targeting is appropriate. A useful resource 
for implementation of respiratory motion management is the report of AAPM Task Group 76.11
• IGRT—including (but not limited to) orthogonal pair planar imaging and/or volumetric imaging (such as CBCT or CT on rails)—is 
recommended when using SABR, 3D-CRT/IMRT, and proton therapy with steep dose gradients around the target, when OARs are in close 
proximity to high-dose regions, and when using complex motion management techniques.
III. Target Volumes, Prescription Doses, and Normal Tissue Dose Constraints (See Tables 2–5 on NSCL-C 7 of 10 and NSCL-C 8 of 10)
• ICRU Reports 62 and 83 detail the current definitions of target volumes for 3D-RT and IMRT. GTV comprises the known extent of disease 
(primary and nodal) on imaging and pathologic assessment, CTV includes regions of presumed microscopic extent or dissemination, and 
PTV comprises the ITV (which includes margin for target motion) plus a setup margin for positioning and mechanical variability.  
https://www.nrgoncology.org/ciro-lung
• PTV margin can be decreased by immobilization, motion management, and IGRT techniques.
• Consistent delineation of normal structures is critical for evaluating plans for safety. The RTOG consensus lung-contouring atlas is a useful 
resource. https://www.nrgoncology.org/ciro-lung
• Commonly used prescription doses and normal tissue dose constraints are summarized in Tables 2 through 5. These are based on 
published experience, ongoing trials, historical data, modeling, and empirical judgment.12,13 Useful references include the recent reviews of 
normal organ dose responses from the QUANTEC project.14-18 Because risk of normal organ toxicity increases with dose, doses to normal 
organs should be kept as low as reasonably achievable rather than simply meeting nominal constraints. This is generally facilitated by more 
advanced techniques to achieve better dose conformity.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY
IV. General Treatment Information 
Early-Stage NSCLC (Stage I, selected node-negative Stage IIA)
• SABR (also known as SBRT)19 has achieved good primary tumor control rates and overall survival, higher than conventionally fractionated 
radiotherapy. Although SABR is not proven equivalent to lobectomy, some prospective series have demonstrated similar overall and cancer-
specific survival.20-30
• SABR is also an appropriate option for patients with high surgical risk (able to tolerate sublobar resection but not lobectomy [eg, age ≥75 
years, poor lung function]). 
• More modestly hypofractionated or dose-intensified conventionally fractionated 3D-CRT regimens are less preferred alternatives and may be 
considered if referral for SABR is not feasible.31-33
• In patients treated with surgery, postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) is not recommended unless there are positive margins or upstaging to N2 
(see Locally Advanced NSCLC in this section).
• Close follow-up and salvage therapy for isolated local and/or locoregional recurrence after SABR have been shown to improve overall 
survival in a large retrospective study.34
SABR for Node-Negative Early-Stage NSCLC
• The high-dose intensity and conformity of SABR require minimizing the PTV.
• Dosing regimen
For SABR, intensive regimens of BED ≥100 Gy are associated with significantly better local control and survival than less intensive 
regimens.35,36 In the United States, only regimens of ≤5 fractions meet the arbitrary billing code definition of SBRT, but slightly more 
protracted regimens are appropriate as well.35,37 For centrally located tumors (defined variably as within 2 cm of the proximal bronchial tree 
and/or abutting mediastinal pleura) and even ultra-central tumors (defined as abutting the proximal bronchial tree), 4 to 10 fraction risk-
adapted SABR regimens appear to be effective and safe,38-41 while 54 to 60 Gy in 3 fractions is unsafe and should be avoided.42 However, 
particular attention should be paid to tumors abutting the bronchial tree and esophagus to avoid severe toxicity. RTOG 0813 evaluated the 
toxicity of 5-fraction regimens and found no high-grade toxicities at 50 Gy in 5 fractions.43
• SABR is most commonly used for tumors up to 5 cm in size, though selected larger isolated tumors can be treated safely if normal tissue 
constraints are respected.43,44  
• Prescription doses incompletely describe the actual delivered doses, which also strongly depend on how the dose is prescribed (to the 
isocenter vs. an isodose volume covering a proportion of the PTV), the degree of dose heterogeneity, whether tissue density heterogeneity 
corrections are used, and the type of dose calculation algorithm.10,45,46 All of these must be considered when interpreting or emulating 
regimens from prior studies.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY
Locally Advanced NSCLC (Stage II–III)
• Concurrent chemotherapy/RT is recommended for patients with inoperable stage II (node-positive) and stage III NSCLC.47-50
• RT interruptions and dose reductions for manageable acute toxicities should be avoided by employing supportive care. 
• Sequential chemotherapy/RT or RT alone is appropriate for frail patients unable to tolerate concurrent therapy.51,52  
Accelerated RT regimens may be beneficial, particularly if concurrent chemotherapy would not be tolerated (ie, in a sequential or RT-only 
approach).53,54
• Preoperative concurrent chemotherapy/RT is an option for patients with resectable stage IIIA (minimal N2 and treatable with lobectomy)55 
NSCLC and is recommended for resectable superior sulcus tumors.56,57 RT should be planned up front such that it continues to a definitive 
dose without interruption if the patient does not proceed to surgery as initially planned. 
• Preoperative chemotherapy and postoperative RT is an alternative for patients with resectable stage IIIA disease.58,59 The optimal timing of 
RT in trimodality therapy (preoperative with chemotherapy or postoperative) is not established and is controversial.60,61
• The determination of resectability in trimodality therapy should be made prior to initiation of all treatment. Upfront multidisciplinary 
consultation is particularly important when considering surgical treatment of patients with stage III NSCLC.
• In patients with clinical stage I/II upstaged surgically to N2+, PORT appears to improve survival significantly as an adjunct to postoperative 
chemotherapy in non-randomized analyses.62,63 Although the optimal sequence is not established, PORT is generally administered after 
postoperative chemotherapy and concurrently with chemotherapy for positive resection margins.64-67
• PORT is not recommended for patients with pathologic stage N0–1 disease, because it has been associated with increased mortality, at least 
when using older RT techniques.68
Conventionally Fractionated RT for Locally Advanced NSCLC
• IFI omitting ENI allows tumor dose escalation and is associated with a low risk of isolated nodal relapse, particularly in a patient staged with 
PET/CT.69-73 Three randomized trials found improved survival for IFI versus ENI, possibly because it enabled dose escalation.74-76 IFI is 
reasonable in order to optimize definitive dosing to the tumor and/or decrease normal tissue toxicity. 75,76
• Dosing Regimens
The most commonly prescribed doses for definitive RT are 60 to 70 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. Doses of at least 60 Gy should be given.77 Dose 
escalation is associated with better survival in non-randomized comparisons in RT alone,78 sequential chemo/RT,79 or concurrent chemo/RT.80 
While optimal RT dose intensification remains a valid question, a high dose of 74 Gy is not currently recommended for routine use.81-86  
A meta-analysis demonstrated improved survival with accelerated fractionation RT regimens,87 and RTOG 1106 found that PET-based 
individualized accelerated RT dose intensification potentially improved local control but not overall survival.88

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY
Conventionally Fractionated RT for Locally Advanced NSCLC (continued)
• Dosing Regimens
Doses of 45 to 54 Gy in 1.8 to 2 Gy fractions are standard preoperative doses.89 Definitive RT doses delivered as preoperative chemoRT can 
safely be administered and achieve promising nodal clearance and survival rates,90-93 but require experience in thoracic surgical techniques to 
minimize the risk of surgical complications after high-dose RT. 
In PORT, the CTV includes the bronchial stump and high-risk draining lymph node stations.94 Standard doses after complete resection are 
50 to 54 Gy in 1.8 to 2 Gy fractions, but a boost may be administered to high-risk regions including areas of nodal extracapsular extension 
or microscopic positive margins.62,63,95 Lung dose constraints should be more conservative, because tolerance appears to be reduced after 
surgery. The ongoing European LungART trial provides useful guidelines for PORT technique.96 
Advanced/Metastatic NSCLC (Stage IV)
• RT is recommended for local palliation or prevention of symptoms (such as pain, bleeding, or obstruction).
• Definitive/consolidative local therapy to isolated or limited metastatic sites (oligometastases) (including but not limited to brain, lung, and adrenal 
gland) achieves prolonged survival in a small proportion of well-selected patients with good performance status who have also received radical 
therapy to the intrathoracic disease.97 Definitive RT to oligometastases (limited number is not universally defined but clinical trials have included 
3–5 metastases), particularly SABR, is an appropriate option in such cases if it can be delivered safely to the involved sites.98,99 In two randomized 
phase II trials, significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival in one trial100,101 were found for local consolidative therapy 
(RT or surgery) to oligometastatic lesions versus maintenance systemic therapy or observation for patients not progressing on systemic 
therapy.100-102
• In the setting of progression at a limited number of sites on a given line of systemic therapy (oligoprogression), local ablative therapy to the 
oligoprogressive sites may extend the duration of benefit of the current line of systemic therapy.
•  When treating oligometastatic/oligoprogressive lesions, if SABR is not feasible, other dose-intensive accelerated/hypofractionated CRT regimens 
may be used.
• See the NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers regarding RT for brain metastases.
• A pooled analysis of two randomized trials indicated that adding radiotherapy to a certain immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1) significantly 
increased responses and clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Larger phase III randomized studies are 
ongoing.103
Palliative RT for Advanced/Metastatic NSCLC
• The dose and fractionation of palliative RT should be individualized based on goals of care, symptoms, performance status, and logistical 
considerations. Shorter courses of RT are preferred for patients with poor performance status and/or shorter life expectancy because they provide 
similar pain relief as longer courses, although there is a higher potential need for retreatment.104-107 For palliation of thoracic symptoms, higher 
dose/longer-course thoracic RT (eg, ≥30 Gy in 10 fractions) is associated with modestly improved survival and symptoms, particularly in patients 
with good performance status.108,109 When higher doses (>30 Gy) are warranted, technologies to reduce normal tissue irradiation (at least 3D-CRT 
and including IMRT or proton therapy as appropriate) may be used. 
• Single-fraction stereotactic RT of 12–16 Gy produced better control of pain response and local control of non-spine bone metastases compared to 
standard 30 Gy in 10 fractions in a randomized phase II trial, and may be promising for patients with longer expected survival.110

Vxx = % of the whole OAR receiving ≥xx Gy.
Please note: Tables 2–5 provide doses and constraints used commonly or in past clinical trials as useful references rather than specific recommendations.
†These constraints represent doses that generally should not be exceeded, based on a 
consensus survey of NCCN Member Institutions. Because the risk of toxicity increases 
progressively with dose to normal tissues, a key principle of radiation treatment planning is 
to keep normal tissue doses "as low as reasonably achievable" while adequately covering 
the target. The doses to any given organ at risk should typically be lower than these 
constraints, approaching them only when there is close proximity to the target volume.

§ Use V20 <35%, especially for the following: elderly ≥70 years, taxane chemotherapy, and 
poor PFTs (such as FEV1 or DLCO <50% normal). Use more conservative limits with a 
diagnosis or radiologic evidence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IDP)/usual interstitial 
pneumonia (UIP) (the tolerance of these patients is lower though not well characterized).

Discussion
General Principles
•  Interventional radiologists should actively participate in multidisciplinary discussions and meetings regarding patients with NSCLC (eg, multidisciplinary 
clinic and/or tumor board).
•  Decisions about whether ablation is feasible should be performed by interventional radiologists who perform IGTA as a prominent part of their practice.  
•  IGTA includes radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation. IGTA is a form of “local therapy” or “local ablative therapy.”1  
•  IGTA is a lung parenchymal sparing technique with at most a temporary decrement in FEV1 and DLCO, which is statistically indistinguishable from 
baseline after recovery.2-6
Evaluation
•  IGTA may be considered for those patients who are deemed “high risk”—those with tumors that are for the most part surgically resectable but rendered 
medically inoperable due to comorbidities. In cases where IGTA is considered for high-risk or borderline operable patients, a multidisciplinary evaluation is 
recommended.
•  IGTA has been successfully accomplished in patients considered “high risk,” objectively defined with a single major and/or two or more minor criteria.  
Major criteria included an FEV1 or DCLO ≤50%, and minor criteria included a less depressed FEV1 or DLCO between 51%–60%, advanced age ≥75 years, 
pulmonary hypertension, LVEF ≤40%, resting or exercise PaO2 <55 mmHg, and pCO2 >45 mmHg.4
•  If an interventional radiologist or center is uncertain about the feasibility or safety of IGTA or the use of IGTA for radiation failure, consider obtaining an 
additional interventional radiology opinion from a high-volume specialized center.
Ablation
•  Each energy modality has advantages and disadvantages. Determination of energy modality to be used for ablation should take into consideration the size 
and location of the target tumor, risk of complication, as well as local expertise and/or operator familiarity.7
Ablation for NSCLC
•  IGTA is an option for the management of NSCLC lesions <3 cm. Ablation for NSCLC lesions >3 cm may be associated with higher rates of local recurrence 
and complications.8,9
•  There is evidence on the use of IGTA for selected patients with Stage 1A NSCLC, those who present with multiple lung cancers, or those who present with 
locoregional recurrence of symptomatic local thoracic disease.
• Like surgery, pneumothorax may occur after IGTA, particularly if multiple lesions are treated in a single session. Pneumothorax has been reported in 
18.7%–45.7% of IGTA cases. Self-limited pneumothorax, not requiring chest tube placement, is an expected event and not considered a complication 
unless escalation of care is required. In 20.7% of IGTA cases, chest tube insertion may be required.10

PRINCIPLES OF MOLECULAR AND BIOMARKER ANALYSIS
Molecular Diagnostic Studies in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
• Numerous gene alterations have been identified that impact therapy selection. Testing of lung cancer specimens for these alterations is important 
for identification of potentially efficacious targeted therapies, as well as avoidance of therapies unlikely to provide clinical benefit.  
• Some selection approaches for targeted therapy include predictive immunohistochemical analyses, which are distinct from immunohistochemical 
studies utilized to identify tumor type and lineage.
• Major elements of molecular testing that are critical for utilization and interpretation of molecular results include:
Use of a laboratory that is properly accredited, with a minimum of CLIA accreditation
Understanding the methodologies that are utilized and the major limitations of those methodologies 
Understanding the spectrum of alterations tested (and those not tested) by a specific assay
Knowledge of whether a tumor sample is subjected to pathologic review and tumor enrichment (ie, microdissection, macrodissection) prior to 
testing
The types of samples accepted by the testing laboratory
• Tissue Specimen Acquisition and Management:
Although tumor testing has been primarily focused on use of FFPE tissues, increasingly, laboratories accept other specimen types, notably 
cytopathology preparations not processed by FFPE methods. Although testing on cell blocks is not included in the FDA approval for multiple 
companion diagnostic assays, testing on these specimen types is highly recommended when it is the only or best material. 
A major limitation in obtaining tissue molecular testing results for NSCLC occurs when minimally invasive techniques are used to obtain samples; 
the yield may be insufficient for molecular, biomarker, and histologic testing. Therefore, bronchoscopists and interventional radiologists should 
procure sufficient tissue to enable all appropriate testing.
When tissue is minimal, laboratories should deploy techniques to maximize tissue for molecular and ancillary testing, including dedicated 
histology protocols for small biopsies, including “up-front” slide sectioning for diagnostic and predictive testing. Peripheral blood (plasma 
circulating tumor DNA) can be a surrogate sample (NSCL-H 7 of 7).

• Testing Methodologies
Appropriate possible testing methodologies are indicated below for each analyte separately; however, several methodologies are generally 
considerations for use:
 ◊ Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is used in clinical laboratories. Not all types of alterations are detected by individual NGS assays and it is 
important to be familiar with the types of alterations identifiable in individual assays or combination(s) of assays.
 ◊ It is recommended at this time that when feasible, testing be performed via a broad, panel-based approach, most typically performed by NGS. 
For patients who, in broad panel testing don’t have identifiable driver oncogenes (especially in never smokers), consider RNA-based NGS if not 
already performed, to maximize detection of fusion events.
 – Broad molecular profiling is defined as molecular testing that identifies all biomarkers identified in NSCL-19 in either a single assay or a 
combination of a limited number of assays, and optimally also identifies emerging biomarkers (NSCL-I). Tiered approaches based on low 
prevalence of co-occurring biomarkers are acceptable.
 ◊ Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used in a highly targeted fashion (specific mutations targeted). When this technology is 
deployed, only those specific alterations that are targeted by the assay are assessed. 
 ◊ Sanger sequencing requires the greatest degree of tumor enrichment. Unmodified Sanger sequencing is not appropriate for detection of 
mutations in tumor samples with less than 25% to 30% tumor after enrichment and is not appropriate for assays in which identification of 
subclonal events (eg, resistance mutations) is important. If Sanger sequencing is utilized, tumor enrichment methodologies are nearly always 
recommended.
 ◊ Any method that interrogates sequences other than a subset of highly specific alterations (eg, NGS, Sanger) has the potential to identify 
variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Any variant classified as a VUS, even if in a gene in which other variants are clinically actionable, 
should not be considered as a basis for targeted therapy selection.
 ◊ Other methodologies may be utilized, including multiplex approaches not listed above.
 ◊ Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis is utilized for many assays examining copy number, amplification, and structural alterations 
such as gene rearrangements.

• Molecular Targets for Analysis
In general, the mutations/alterations described below are seen in a non-overlapping fashion, although between 1%–3% of NSCLC may harbor 
concurrent alterations.
EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) Gene Mutations: EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase normally found on the surface of epithelial cells and 
is often overexpressed in a variety of human malignancies. 
 ◊ The most commonly described mutations in EGFR (exon 19 deletions, p.L858R point mutation in exon 21) are associated with responsiveness to 
oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy; most recent data indicate that tumors that do not harbor a sensitizing EGFR mutation should not 
be treated with EGFR TKI in any line of therapy.
 ◊ Molecular testing for EGFR mutations should be performed when adjuvant TKI therapy is a consideration for NSCLC stage IB–IIIA. While the 
testing process may be technically easier on a resection specimen, initial diagnostic biopsy specimens are also acceptable for testing for this 
indication. 
 ◊ Many of the less commonly observed alterations in EGFR, which cumulatively account for ~10% of EGFR-mutation positive NSCLC (ie, exon 19 
insertions, p.L861Q, p.G719X, p.S768I) are also associated with responsiveness to certain EGFR TKIs, such as osimertinib and afatinib, and should 
be considered on a mutation-specific basis, when possible.
 ◊ EGFR p.T790M is most commonly observed as a mutation that arises in response to and as a mechanism of resistance to first- and second-
generation EGFR TKI. In patients with progression on first- or second-generation TKI with p.T790M as the primary mechanism of resistance, third-
generation TKIs are typically efficacious. 
 – If EGFR p.T790M is identified in the absence of prior EGFR TKI therapy, genetic counseling and possible germline genetic testing are warranted. 
Identification of germline EGFR p.T790M confers a high risk for lung cancer regardless of smoking status.
 ◊ EGFR exon 20 (EGFRex20) mutations (other than EGFR p.T790M) are a heterogeneous group, some of which are responsive to targeted therapy 
and that require detailed knowledge of the specific alteration. 
 – Most EGFRex20 alterations are a diverse group of in-frame duplication or insertion mutations.  
 ▪ These are generally associated with lack of response to first-, second-, and third-generation EGFR TKI therapy, with select exceptions: 
p.A763_Y764insFQEA is associated with sensitivity to TKI therapy and p.A763_Y764insLQEA may be associated with sensitivity to first- and 
third-generation TKI therapy. 
 ▪ EGFRex20 insertions/duplications are associated with responsiveness to specific targeted subsequent therapy agents. The most commonly 
represented EGFRex20 insertions/duplications in the clinical studies have been insASV, insSVD, and insNPH, although a wide spectrum of 
other alterations were included. There is currently no evidence that the specific alteration type impacts the probability of responsiveness to 
this class of kinase inhibitor. 
 ▪ Because some EGFRex20 mutations are or may be sensitive to first- and third-generation inhibitors, the specific sequence of EGFRex20 
insertion mutations remains important. Some assays will identify the presence of an EGFRex20 insertion without specifying the sequence, and 
additional testing to further clarify the EGFRex20 insertion may be indicated for therapy selection.
 ▪ Targeted PCR-based approaches for detection of EGFR variants may under-detect EGFRex20 insertion events; therefore, NGS-based strategies 
are preferred.  
 ◊ Some clinicopathologic features—such as smoking status, ethnicity, and histology—are associated with the presence of an EGFR mutation; 
however, these features should not be utilized in selecting patients for testing.
 ◊ Testing Methodologies: Real-time PCR, Sanger sequencing (ideally paired with tumor enrichment), and NGS are the most commonly deployed 
methodologies for examining EGFR mutation status.

• Molecular Targets for Analysis (continued)
ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) Gene Rearrangements: ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that can be rearranged in NSCLC, resulting in 
dysregulation and inappropriate signaling through the ALK kinase domain.
 ◊ The most common fusion partner seen with ALK is echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4), although a variety of other fusion 
partners have been identified.
 ◊ The presence of an ALK rearrangement is associated with responsiveness to oral ALK TKIs.
 ◊ Some clinicopathologic features—such as smoking status and histology—have been associated with the presence of an ALK rearrangement; 
however, these features should not be utilized in selecting patients for testing.
 ◊ Testing Methodologies: FISH break-apart probe methodology was the first methodology deployed widely. IHC can be deployed as an effective 
screening strategy. FDA-approved IHC can be utilized as a stand-alone test, not requiring confirmation by FISH. Numerous NGS methodologies 
can detect ALK fusions. Targeted real-time PCR assays are used in some settings, although it is unlikely to detect fusions with novel partners.
ROS1 (ROS proto-oncogene 1) Gene Rearrangements: ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that can be rearranged in NSCLC, resulting in 
dysregulation and inappropriate signaling through the ROS1 kinase domain.
 ◊ Numerous fusion partners are seen with ROS1, and common fusion partners include: CD74, SLC34A2, CCDC6, and GOPC (FIG).
 ◊ The presence of a ROS1 rearrangement is associated with responsiveness to oral ROS1 TKIs.
 ◊ Some clinicopathologic features—such as smoking status and histology—have been associated with the presence of a ROS1 rearrangement; 
however, these features should not be utilized in selecting patients for testing.
 ◊ Testing Methodologies: FISH break-apart probe methodology can be deployed; however, it may under-detect the FIG-ROS1 variant. IHC 
approaches can be deployed; however, IHC for ROS1 fusions has low specificity, and follow-up confirmatory testing is a necessary component 
of utilizing ROS1 IHC as a screening modality. Numerous NGS methodologies can detect ROS1 fusions, although DNA-based NGS may under-
detect ROS1 fusions. Targeted real-time PCR assays are utilized in some settings, although they are unlikely to detect fusions with novel 
partners.

PRINCIPLES OF MOLECULAR AND BIOMARKER ANALYSIS
• Molecular Targets for Analysis (continued)
BRAF (B-Raf proto-oncogene) point mutations: BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase that is part of the canonical MAP/ERK signaling pathway. 
Activating mutations in BRAF result in unregulated signaling through the MAP/ERK pathway.
 ◊ Mutations in BRAF can be seen in NSCLC. The presence of a specific mutation resulting in a change in amino acid position 600 (p.V600E) has 
been associated with responsiveness to combined therapy with oral inhibitors of BRAF and MEK.
 ◊ Note that other mutations in BRAF are observed in NSCLC, and the impact of those mutations on therapy selection is not well understood at 
this time.
 ◊ Testing Methodologies: Real-time PCR, Sanger sequencing (ideally paired with tumor enrichment), and NGS are the most commonly deployed 
methodologies for examining BRAF mutation status. While an anti-BRAF p.V600E-specific monoclonal antibody is commercially available, and 
some studies have examined utilizing this approach, it should only be deployed after extensive validation. 
KRAS (KRAS proto-oncogene) point mutations: KRAS is a G-protein with intrinsic GTPase activity, and activating mutations result in 
unregulated signaling through the MAP/ERK pathway.
 ◊ Mutations in KRAS are most commonly seen at codon 12, although other mutations can be seen in NSCLC.
 ◊ The presence of a KRAS mutation is prognostic of poor survival when compared to patients with tumors without KRAS mutation.
 ◊ Mutations in KRAS have been associated with reduced responsiveness to EGFR TKI therapy. 
 ◊ Owing to the low probability of overlapping targetable alterations, the presence of a known activating mutation in KRAS identifies patients who 
are unlikely to benefit from further molecular testing.
 ◊ The presence of KRAS p.G12C is associated with responsiveness to an oral KRAS G12C inhibitor used for subsequent therapy, which was 
designed specifically for this mutation. Responsiveness to this class of inhibitor has not been prospectively evaluated with mutations other 
than KRAS p.G12C.
 ◊ Testing methodologies: NGS, real-time PCR, and Sanger sequencing (ideally paired with tumor enrichment) are the most commonly deployed 
methodologies for examining KRAS mutation status. 
MET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition) exon 14 (METex14) skipping variants: MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase. A mutation that results in loss of 
exon 14 can occur in NSCLC. Loss of METex14 leads to dysregulation and inappropriate signaling.
 ◊ The presence of METex14 skipping mutation is associated with responsiveness to oral MET TKIs.
 ◊ A broad range of molecular alterations lead to METex14 skipping.
 ◊ Testing Methodologies: NGS-based testing is the primary method for detection of METex14 skipping events; RNA-based NGS may have 
improved detection. IHC is not a method for detection of METex14 skipping.
RET (rearranged during transfection) Gene Rearrangements: RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that can be rearranged in NSCLC, resulting in 
dysregulation and inappropriate signaling through the RET kinase domain.
 ◊ Common fusion partners are KIF5B, NCOA4, and CCDC6; however, numerous other fusion partners have been identified.
 ◊ The presence of a RET rearrangement is associated with responsiveness to oral RET TKIs regardless of fusion partner.
 ◊ Testing Methodologies: FISH break-apart probe methodology can be deployed; however, it may under-detect some fusions. Targeted real-time 
reverse-transcriptase PCR assays are utilized in some settings, although they are unlikely to detect fusions with novel partners. NGS-based 
methodology has a high specificity, and RNA-based NGS is preferable to DNA-based NGS for fusion detection.

PRINCIPLES OF MOLECULAR AND BIOMARKER ANALYSIS
• Molecular Targets for Analysis (continued)
NTRK1/2/3 (neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase) gene fusions
 ◊ The presence of NTRK1/2/3 gene fusions is associated with responsiveness to oral TRK inhibitors.
 ◊ NTRK1/2/3 are tyrosine receptor kinases that are rarely rearranged in NSCLC as well as in other tumor types, resulting in dysregulation and 
inappropriate signaling. 
 ◊ Numerous fusion partners have been identified. 
 ◊ To date, no specific clinicopathologic features, other than absence of other driver alterations, have been identified in association with these 
fusions. 
 ◊ Point mutations in NTRK1/2/3 are generally non-activating and have not been studied in association with targeted therapy.
 ◊ Testing Methodologies: Various methodologies can be used to detect NTRK1/2/3 gene fusions, including: FISH, IHC, PCR, and NGS; false 
negatives may occur. IHC methods are complicated by baseline expression in some tissues. FISH testing may require at least 3 probe sets for 
full analysis. NGS testing can detect a broad range of alterations. DNA-based NGS may under-detect NTRK1 and NTRK3 fusions.
•  In the event that a complete assessment for all biomarkers cannot be reasonably accomplished prior to initiation of therapy, consider repeat panel 
testing or selected biomarker testing at progression on first-line therapy if a lesion can be accessed for sampling and testing.
• Testing in the Setting of Progression on Targeted Therapy:
For many of the above listed analytes, there is growing recognition of the molecular mechanisms of resistance to therapy. Re-testing of a sample 
from a tumor that is actively progressing while exposed to targeted therapy can shed light on appropriate next therapeutic steps:
 ◊ For patients with an underlying EGFR sensitizing mutation who have been treated with EGFR TKI, minimum appropriate testing includes high-
sensitivity evaluation for p.T790M; when there is no evidence of p.T790M, testing for alternate mechanisms of resistance (MET amplification, 
ERBB2 amplification) may be used to direct patients for additional therapies. The presence of p.T790M can direct patients to third-generation 
EGFR TKI therapy.  
 – Assays for the detection of EGFR p.T790M should be designed to have an analytic sensitivity of a minimum of 5% allelic fraction. The original 
sensitizing mutation can be utilized as an internal control in many assays to determine whether a p.T790M is within the range of detection if 
present as a sub-clonal event.
 ◊ For patients with underlying ALK rearrangement who have been treated with ALK TKI, it is unclear whether identification of specific tyrosine 
kinase domain mutation can identify appropriate next steps in therapy, although some preliminary data suggest that specific kinase domain 
mutations can impact next line of therapy.
 ◊  Broad genomic profiling may be the most informative approach to examining potential mechanisms of resistance, which may require more than 
one instance of such profiling over the course of an individual patient’s therapy.
• Testing in the setting of a limited number of pulmonary nodules can aid in distinguishing separate primary lung carcinoma versus intrapulmonary 
metastatic disease.
Studies to explore tumor relatedness by testing tissue from separately sampled lesions using a broad gene coverage NGS approach suggest it 
may be superior to histopathologic assessment. 
Tumor pairs exhibiting entirely non-overlapping, unique mutations are considered clonally unrelated separate primary lung cancers, even if 
histologically similar. Tumors that share multiple (≥2) mutations are more likely to be clonally related; however, this may depend on the extent to 
which any individual mutation is extremely common in NSCLC and whether identified alterations are driver or passenger alterations. Results in 
which no mutations or only one mutation are identified are not informative for this evaluation.

PRINCIPLES OF MOLECULAR AND BIOMARKER ANALYSIS
• PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1): PD-L1 is a co-regulatory molecule that can be expressed on tumor cells and inhibit T-cell–mediated cell death. 
T-cells express PD-1, a negative regulator, which binds to ligands including PD-L1 (CD274) or PD-L2 (CD273). In the presence of PD-L1, T-cell 
activity is suppressed.
Checkpoint inhibitor antibodies block the PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction, thereby improving the antitumor effects of endogenous T cells.
IHC for PD-L1 can be utilized to identify disease most likely to respond to first-line anti PD-1/PD-L1.
 ◊ Various antibody clones have been developed for IHC analysis of PD-L1 expression, and while several are comparable regarding intensity and 
proportion of cells stained, some are not.
 – The definition of positive and negative testing is dependent on the individual antibody, clone, and platform deployed, which may be unique 
to each checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The approval of multiple different assays for PD-L1 has raised concern among both pathologists and 
oncologists.
 – While some clones for PD-L1 IHC are FDA-approved for specific indications, use of multiple IHC tests is not necessary, provided any 
individual IHC test has been internally validated for comparability for categorical results against the FDA-approved clone.  
 – Interpretation of PD-L1 IHC in NSCLC is typically focused on the proportion of tumor cells expressing membranous staining at any level and 
therefore is a linear variable; scoring systems may be different in other tumor types. 
 ◊ Although PD-L1 expression can be elevated in patients with an oncogenic driver, targeted therapy for the oncogenic driver should take 
precedence over treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. 
• Plasma Cell-Free/Circulating Tumor DNA Testing: 
Cell-free/circulating tumor DNA testing should not be used in lieu of a histologic tissue diagnosis.
Some laboratories offer testing for molecular alterations examining nucleic acids in peripheral circulation, most commonly in processed plasma 
(sometimes referred to as "liquid biopsy").  
Studies have demonstrated cell-free tumor DNA testing to generally have very high specificity, but significantly compromised sensitivity, with up 
to a 30% false-negative rate; however, data support complementary testing to reduce turnaround time and increase yield of targetable alteration 
detection.
Published guidelines elaborating standards for analytical performance characteristics of cell-free tumor DNA have not been established, and in 
contrast to tissue-based testing, no guidelines exist regarding the recommended performance characteristics of this type of testing.
Cell-free tumor DNA testing can identify alterations that are unrelated to a lesion of interest, for example, clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate 
potential (CHIP).
The use of cell-free/circulating tumor DNA testing can be considered in specific clinical circumstances, most notably:
 ◊ If a patient is medically unfit for invasive tissue sampling
 ◊ In the initial diagnostic setting, if following pathologic confirmation of a NSCLC diagnosis there is insufficient material for molecular analysis, 
cell-free/circulating tumor DNA should be used only if follow-up tissue-based analysis is planned for all patients in which an oncogenic driver is 
not identified (see NSCL-18 for oncogenic drivers with available targeted therapy options).
 ◊ In the initial diagnostic setting, if tissue-based testing does not completely assess all recommended biomarkers owing to tissue quantity or 
testing methodologies available, consider repeat biopsy and/or cell-free/circulating tumor DNA testing.

Continued
a Albumin-bound paclitaxel may be substituted for either paclitaxel or docetaxel in patients who 
have experienced hypersensitivity reactions after receiving paclitaxel or docetaxel despite 
premedication, or for patients where the standard premedications (ie, dexamethasone, H2 
blockers, H1 blockers) are contraindicated. 
b Carboplatin-based regimens are often used for patients with comorbidities or those who cannot 
tolerate cisplatin.
C If first-line systemic therapy completed before treatment for an actionable mutation, and 
disease has progressed, see Subsequent Therapy NSCL-K 4 of 5. 
d Contraindications for treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors may include active or previously 
documented autoimmune disease and/or current use of immunosuppressive agents, or 
presence of an oncogene (ie, EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R, ALK rearrangements), which 
would predict lack of benefit.  
e If progression on PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, using a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor is not recommended. 
f An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for bevacizumab.
g Bevacizumab should be given until progression.
h Any regimen with a high risk of thrombocytopenia and the potential risk of bleeding should be 
used with caution in combination with bevacizumab.
i Criteria for treatment with bevacizumab: non-squamous NSCLC, and no recent history of 
hemoptysis. Bevacizumab should not be given as a single agent, unless as maintenance if 
initially used with chemotherapy.

SYSTEMIC THERAPY FOR ADVANCED OR METASTATIC DISEASE – MAINTENANCE
Maintenance Therapy
• Continuation maintenance refers to the use of at least one of the agents given in first line, beyond 4–6 cycles, in the absence of disease 
progression. Switch maintenance refers to the initiation of a different agent, not included as part of the first-line regimen, in the absence of 
disease progression, after 4–6 cycles of initial therapy. 
• Patients should receive maintenance therapy for 2 years if they received front-line immunotherapy.
• Patients should receive maintenance therapy until progression if they received second-line immunotherapy.

tumor, and the fluid is nonbloody and not an exudate. If these elements and clinical judgment dictate that the effusion is not related to the tumor, the effusion should be excluded as a 
staging descriptor.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
 
MS-3 
Overview 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States.1 In 
2020, an estimated 228,820 new cases (116,300 in men and 112,520 in 
women) of lung and bronchial cancer will be diagnosed, and 135,720 
deaths (72,500 in men and 63,220 in women) are estimated to occur 
because of the disease.2 Only 19% of all patients with lung cancer are 
alive 5 years or more after diagnosis, which includes patients with both 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).3 
From 2009 to 2015, the overall 5-year relative survival rate for NSCLC 
was 25% in the United States.3 However, much progress has been made 
recently for lung cancer such as screening, minimally invasive techniques 
for diagnosis and treatment, and advances in radiation therapy (RT) 
including stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), targeted therapies, 
and immunotherapies.4-9 Patients with metastatic lung cancer who are 
eligible for targeted therapies or immunotherapies are now surviving 
longer; 5-year survival rates range from 15% to 50%, depending on the 
biomarker.9-19 Thus, death rates for lung cancer have been declining, 
although there are still more deaths from lung cancer than from breast, 
prostate, colorectal, and brain cancers combined together.2 Common 
symptoms of lung cancer include cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, weight 
loss, and chest pain; patients with symptoms are more likely to have 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).20  
These NCCN Guidelines® for NSCLC were first published in 1996.21 
Subsequently, the NCCN Guidelines® have been updated at least once a 
year by the NCCN NSCLC Panel; there were 8 updates for the 2020 
guidelines. The Summary of the Guidelines Updates describes the most 
recent revisions to the algorithms, which have been incorporated into this 
updated Discussion text (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC and 
Summary in this Discussion). For example, the NCCN NSCLC Panel has 
preference stratified the systemic therapy regimens for the 2020 update 
(Version 1) based on the biomedical literature and experience of the panel 
members using the following categories: 1) preferred interventions; 2) 
other recommended interventions; and 3) interventions that are useful in 
certain circumstances (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).22 These 
new preference categories are intended to emphasize the preferred 
regimens in clinical practice and are not intended to replace the NCCN 
categories of evidence and consensus, such as category 1 or category 2A.  
The NCCN Guidelines also provide specific category designations for all 
treatment interventions in the guidelines, which are based on evidence 
from the biomedical literature and consensus among the panel members. 
Category 1 recommendations indicate uniform NCCN consensus (at least 
85% of the panel vote) that the intervention is appropriate based on 
high-level evidence, such as randomized phase 3 trials. Category 2A 
recommendations indicate uniform NCCN consensus that the intervention 
is appropriate based on lower level evidence, such as phase 2 trials. It is 
important to note that all recommendations are category 2A in the NCCN 
Guidelines unless otherwise indicated. Category 2B recommendations 
indicate NCCN consensus (50% to <85% of the panel vote) that the 
intervention is appropriate based on lower level evidence. Category 3 
recommendations indicate major NCCN disagreement (at least 50% of the 
panel vote) that the intervention is appropriate based on any level of 
evidence. For a category 3 recommendation to remain in the guideline, at 
least 25% of the panel must vote that the intervention is appropriate. By 
definition, the NCCN Guidelines cannot incorporate all possible clinical 
variations and are not intended to replace good clinical judgment or 
individualization of treatments.  
Literature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update Methodology 
An electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain 
key literature in NSCLC using the following search term: non-small cell 
lung cancer. The PubMed database was chosen because it is the most 
widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer-reviewed

biomedical literature. The search results were narrowed by selecting 
studies in humans published in English. Results were confined to the 
following article types: Clinical Trial, Phase 2; Clinical Trial, Phase 3; 
Clinical Trial, Phase 4; Guideline; Meta-Analysis; Randomized Controlled 
Trial; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies.  
The data from key PubMed articles selected by the NCCN NSCLC Panel 
for review during the NCCN Guidelines update meeting, as well as articles 
from additional sources deemed as relevant to these Guidelines and 
discussed by the panel, have been included in this version of the 
Discussion section (eg, e-publications ahead of print, meeting abstracts). If 
high-level evidence is lacking, recommendations are based on the panel’s 
review of lower-level evidence and expert opinion. The complete details of 
the development and update of the NCCN Guidelines are available at 
www.NCCN.org.  
Risk Factors 
The primary risk factor for lung cancer is smoking tobacco, which accounts 
for most lung cancer-related deaths.1,23-27 Cigarette smoke contains many 
carcinogenic chemicals (eg, nitrosamines, benzo(a)pyrene diol 
epoxide).26,28 The risk for lung cancer increases with the number of packs 
of cigarettes smoked per day and with the number of years spent smoking 
(ie, pack-years of smoking history). Exposed nonsmokers also have an 
increased relative risk (RR = 1.24) of developing lung cancer from 
secondhand smoke; other studies have reported a modest risk (hazard 
ratio [HR], 1.05).24,28-31  
Other possible risk factors for lung cancer include disease history (eg, 
COPD), cancer history, family history of lung cancer, and exposure to 
other carcinogens (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening, 
available at www.NCCN.org).32,33 The International Agency for Research 
on Cancer lists several agents known to cause lung cancer, including 
arsenic, chromium, asbestos, nickel, cadmium, beryllium, silica, and diesel 
fumes.34-36 Asbestos is a known carcinogen that increases the risk for lung 
cancer in people exposed to airborne fibers, especially in individuals who 
smoke. It is estimated that about 3% to 4% of lung cancers are caused by 
asbestos exposure.37 Asbestos also causes malignant pleural 
mesothelioma (see the NCCN Guidelines for Malignant Pleural 
Mesothelioma, available at www.NCCN.org). Radon gas, a radioactive gas 
that is produced by the decay of radium 226, also seems to cause lung 
cancer. 
It is not clear whether hormone replacement therapy (HRT) affects the risk 
for lung cancer in women. More than 20 studies have been published, but 
the results have been inconsistent. In a large randomized controlled study, 
no increase in the incidence of lung cancer was found among 
postmenopausal women treated with estrogen plus progestin HRT; 
however, the risk of death increased in those with NSCLC.38 In women 
who received estrogen alone, the incidence or risk of death from lung 
cancer did not increase.39  
Smoking Cessation 
Approximately 85% to 90% of cases of lung cancer are caused by 
cigarette smoking.25 Active smoking causes lung cancer; former smokers 
are at increased risk for lung cancer compared with never smokers. There 
is a causal relationship between active smoking and lung cancer and also 
between other cancers (eg, esophageal, oral cavity, laryngeal, pharyngeal, 
bladder, pancreatic, gastric, kidney, ovarian cancer, colorectal, and 
cervical cancers) and other diseases and conditions.25 Smoking harms 
nearly every organ in the body; smokers have increased mortality 
compared with nonsmokers.40 Those who live with someone who smokes 
have an increased risk for lung cancer.29 Further complicating this 
problem, cigarettes also contain nicotine, which is a highly addictive 
substance.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2022 
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
 
MS-5 
Oncologists should encourage smoking cessation, especially in patients 
with cancer (see the NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation, available 
at www.NCCN.org).41-44 The 5 A’s framework is a useful tool (that is, Ask, 
Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange).45 It is in the best interest of patients to 
quit smoking. Persistent smoking is associated with second primary 
cancers, treatment complications, and decreased survival.46 Some 
surgeons will not operate on a current smoker, because active smoking 
may increase postoperative pulmonary complications.47 However, active 
smoking should not be used to exclude patients with early-stage lung 
cancer from surgical treatment that will prolong survival. Programs using 
behavioral counseling combined with medications that promote smoking 
cessation (approved by the FDA) can be very useful.48 The American 
Cancer Society (ACS) has a Guide to Quitting Smoking. 
Agents that can be used to promote smoking cessation include nicotine 
replacement (eg, gum, inhaler, lozenge, nasal spray, patch), bupropion 
sustained release, and varenicline.49,50 A study suggests that cytisine is 
more efficacious than nicotine replacement therapy, although more side 
effects were reported with cytisine such as nausea, vomiting, and sleep 
disorders.51 Studies have shown that varenicline is better than bupropion 
or nicotine patch for smoking cessation.52-54 The effectiveness of 
varenicline for preventing relapse has not been clearly established.55 The 
FDA has issued an alert for varenicline regarding neuropsychiatric 
symptoms. Varenicline has also been associated with visual disturbances, 
movement disorders, unconsciousness, and cardiovascular disorders; 
therefore, it is banned in truck and bus drivers, pilots, and air traffic 
controllers.56-59 Other side effects with varenicline include nausea, 
abnormal dreams, insomnia, and headache.54,60,61 Bupropion may also be 
associated with similar serious neuropsychiatric symptoms. Nicotine 
replacement has fewer adverse effects than varenicline or bupropion.62 In 
spite of the potential adverse effects, it is probably more beneficial for 
motivated patients to use agents to promote smoking cessation.62  
Lung Cancer Screening 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide in men, and 
late diagnosis is a major obstacle to improving lung cancer outcomes.1,63,64 
Because localized cancer can be managed with curative intent and 
because the mortality rate in other solid tumors (eg, cervix, colon) seems 
to be decreased by screening and early detection, lung cancer is an 
appropriate candidate for a population-based screening approach.  
The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) (ACRIN Protocol A6654) was a 
randomized controlled study involving more than 53,000 current or former 
heavy smokers that assessed the risks and benefits of low-dose CT scans 
compared with chest radiographs for detecting lung cancer.65 Data from 
the NLST showed that screening individuals with high-risk factors using 
low-dose CT decreased the mortality rate from lung cancer by 20%.66 
Individuals with high-risk factors were either current or former smokers 
with a 30 or more pack-year smoking history (former smokers had quit up 
to 15 years before enrollment), were 55 to 74 years of age, and had no 
evidence of lung cancer.65,67 The NCCN, ACS, U.S. Preventive Services 
Task Force (USPSTF), American College of Chest Physicians, European 
Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), and other organizations 
recommend lung cancer screening using low-dose CT for select high-risk 
current and former smokers (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer 
Screening, available at www.NCCN.org).68-71 Low-dose CT screening and 
follow-up are not a substitute for smoking cessation; patients should be 
offered smoking cessation counseling (see NCCN Guidelines for Smoking 
Cessation, available at www.NCCN.org).  
Classification and Prognostic Factors  
WHO divides lung cancer into 2 major classes based on its biology, 
therapy, and prognosis: NSCLC (discussed in these guidelines) and SCLC 
(see the NCCN Guidelines for Small Cell Lung Cancer, available at 
www.NCCN.org).72,73 NSCLC accounts for more than 80% of all lung

MS-6 
cancer cases, and it includes 2 major types: 1) nonsquamous (including 
adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and other subtypes); and 2) 
squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma.3 Adenocarcinoma is the most 
common subtype of lung cancer seen in the United States and is also the 
most frequently occurring histology in nonsmokers. In 2011, an 
international panel revised the classification of lung adenocarcinoma (see 
the Pathologic Evaluation of Lung Cancer in this Discussion), which has 
been adopted by WHO.72-74 All NSCLC should be classified according to 
subtype using the WHO Guidelines.73 Recently, the NCCN NSCLC Panel 
extensively revised the pathology section (see Principles of Pathologic 
Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC and Pathologic Evaluation of 
Lung Cancer in this Discussion). Some of the recent changes include the 
addition of information about adenosquamous carcinomas, large cell 
carcinomas, and carcinoid tumors. Certain prognostic factors are 
predictive of survival in patients with NSCLC. Good prognostic factors 
include early-stage disease at diagnosis, good performance status (PS) 
(ECOG 0, 1), no significant weight loss (<5%), and female gender.75  
Diagnostic Evaluation  
Incidental Lung Nodules  
Lung cancer screening is recommended for early diagnosis in 
asymptomatic patients at high risk. Risk assessment is used to determine 
which individuals are at high risk for lung cancer and thus are candidates 
for screening with low-dose CT.76 Clinicians are referred to the NCCN 
Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening for risk assessment criteria to 
determine which patients are eligible for screening and for how to evaluate 
and follow up on low-dose CT screening findings.77 The NCCN Guidelines 
for Lung Cancer Screening have been revised to harmonize with the 
LungRADs system developed by the American College of Radiology with 
the goal of decreasing the false-positive low-dose CT screening results 
reported in the NLST.78  
The diagnostic algorithm for pulmonary nodules in the NCCN Guidelines 
for NSCLC incorporates information from the NCCN Guidelines for Lung 
Cancer Screening. Recently, the NCCN NSCLC Panel revised the 
diagnostic algorithms for incidental solid and subsolid lung nodules 
detected on chest CT based on the updated Fleischner criteria (see the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).79-83 The cutoff thresholds were increased to 
6 mm for a positive scan result. Note that the Fleischner Society 
Guidelines do not specify whether a CT with contrast is necessary for 
follow-up or whether a low-dose CT is sufficient. Low-dose CT is preferred 
unless contrast enhancement is needed for better diagnostic resolution.  
Solid and subsolid nodules are the 2 main types of pulmonary nodules that 
may be seen on chest CT scans. The Fleischner Society has 
recommendations for patients with solid and subsolid nodules.80,81 
Subsolid nodules include: 1) nonsolid nodules also known as ground-glass 
opacities (GGOs) or ground-glass nodules (GGNs); and 2) part-solid 
nodules, which contain both ground-glass and solid components.81,84-86 
Nonsolid nodules are mainly adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) or minimally 
invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), formerly known as bronchioloalveolar 
carcinoma (BAC) (see Adenocarcinoma in this Discussion); patients have 
5-year disease-free survival of 100% if these nonsolid nodules are 
completely resected.74,81,84,85,87-89 Data suggest that many nonsolid nodules 
discovered incidentally on CT imaging will resolve and many of those that 
persist may not progress to clinically significant cancer.87,90,91 Solid and 
part-solid nodules are more likely to be invasive, faster-growing cancers, 
factors that are reflected in the increased suspicion and follow-up of these 
nodules (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening, available 
at www.NCCN.org).77,80,81  
All findings and factors for a patient need to be carefully evaluated in a 
multidisciplinary diagnostic team before establishing a diagnosis of lung 
cancer and before starting treatment. The NCCN Guidelines recommend

biopsy or surgical excision for highly suspicious nodules seen on low-dose 
CT scans or further surveillance for nodules with a low suspicion of cancer 
depending on the type of nodule and a multidisciplinary evaluation of other 
patient factors (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening, 
available at www.NCCN.org). For patients having repeat scans, the most 
important radiologic factor is change or stability of a nodule when 
compared with a previous imaging study. False-positive results (eg, 
benign intrapulmonary lymph nodes, noncalcified granulomas) frequently 
occurred with low-dose CT when using the original cutoffs for nodule size 
deemed suspicious for malignancy from the NLST.66 The revised cutoff 
values for suspicious nodules recommended by the American College of 
Radiology and incorporated into the LungRADs system have been 
reported to decrease the false-positive rate from low-dose CT.92-94  
Larger Tumors 
The NCCN Guidelines recommend that the diagnostic strategy should be 
individualized for each patient depending on the size and location of the 
tumor, the presence of mediastinal or distant disease, patient 
characteristics (eg, comorbidities), and local expertise. The diagnostic 
strategy needs to be decided in a multidisciplinary setting. Decisions 
regarding whether a biopsy (including what type of biopsy) or surgical 
excision is appropriate depend on several factors as outlined in the 
NSCLC algorithm (see Principles of Diagnostic Evaluation in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). For example, a preoperative biopsy may be 
appropriate if an intraoperative diagnosis seems to be difficult or very risky 
(such as a small and central lesion, where it is difficult to wedge or do 
intraoperative core needle biopsy). The preferred biopsy technique 
depends on the disease site and is described in the NSCLC algorithm (see 
Principles of Diagnostic Evaluation). For example, radial endobronchial 
ultrasound (EBUS; also known as endosonography), navigational 
bronchoscopy, or transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA) are 
recommended for patients with suspected peripheral nodules.95  
PET/CT imaging is useful before selecting a biopsy site, because it is 
better to biopsy the site that will confer the highest stage. For patients with 
suspected nodal disease, pathologic mediastinal lymph node evaluation is 
recommended with either noninvasive or invasive staging methods, 
including endoscopic ultrasound–guided fine-needle aspiration 
(EUS-FNA), EBUS–guided transbronchial needle aspiration 
(EBUS-TBNA), navigational bronchoscopy, or mediastinoscopy (see in 
this Discussion and Principles of Diagnostic Evaluation in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). Clinicians use both noninvasive and invasive 
methods when staging patients.96 EBUS provides access to nodal stations 
2R/2L, 4R/4L, 7, 10R/10L, and other hilar nodal stations. EUS provides 
access to nodal stations 5, 7, 8, and 9. 
If pathology results from biopsy or surgical excision indicate a diagnosis of 
NSCLC, then further evaluation and staging need to be done so that the 
patient’s health care team can determine the most appropriate and 
effective treatment plan (see Pathologic Evaluation of Lung Cancer, 
Staging, and Clinical Evaluation in this Discussion and the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). Diagnosis, staging, and planned resection (eg, 
lobectomy) are ideally one operative procedure for patients with 
early-stage disease (see the Principles of Diagnostic Evaluation in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). A preoperative or intraoperative tissue 
diagnosis of lung cancer should be established before doing a lobectomy.  
Pathologic Evaluation of Lung Cancer  
Pathologic evaluation is performed to classify the histologic subtype of the 
lung cancer, determine the extent of invasion, determine whether it is 
primary lung cancer or metastatic cancer, establish the cancer 
involvement status of the surgical margins (ie, positive or negative 
margins), and do molecular diagnostic studies to determine whether 
certain gene variants are present (eg, epidermal growth factor receptor 
[EGFR] mutations) (see Principles of Pathologic Review in the NCCN

Guidelines for NSCLC).97 Data show that targeted therapy is potentially 
very effective in patients with specific gene variants such as EGFR 
mutations or ALK fusions; therefore, tissue needs to be conserved for 
molecular testing (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in 
the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).7,98-107  
Preoperative evaluations include examination of the following: bronchial 
brushings, bronchial washings, sputum, FNA biopsy, core needle biopsy, 
endobronchial biopsy, and transbronchial biopsy.95,108 Minimally invasive 
techniques can be used to obtain specimens in patients with advanced 
unresectable NSCLC;109,110 however, diagnosis may be more difficult when 
using small biopsies and cytology.88 Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) may 
be used to ensure transbronchial needle aspirates or EBUS specimens 
are adequate for molecular testing.111,112 The mediastinal lymph nodes are 
systematically sampled to determine the staging and therapeutic options. 
Other lung diseases also need to be ruled out (eg, tuberculosis, 
sarcoidosis, coccidioidomycosis).113-115 Lobectomy or pneumonectomy 
specimens are evaluated intraoperatively to determine the surgical 
resection margin status, diagnose incidental nodules discovered at the 
time of surgery, or evaluate the regional lymph nodes.  
Postoperative evaluation provides the pathology characteristics necessary 
for the classification of tumor type, staging, and prognostic factors. The 
surgical pathology report should include the WHO histologic classification 
for carcinomas of the lung.72,73,116 In 2011, the classification for lung 
adenocarcinoma was revised by an international panel, which has been 
adopted by the WHO (see Adenocarcinoma in this Discussion).72-74 The 
revised classification recommends immunohistochemical (IHC) and 
molecular studies (see Principles of Pathologic Review in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).117 In addition, the revised classification 
recommends that use of general categories (eg, non-small cell carcinoma 
[NSCC], NSCC not otherwise specified [NOS]) should be minimized, 
because more effective treatment can be selected when the histology is 
known.  
Recently, the NCCN NSCLC Panel extensively revised the pathology 
section in the algorithm, including new information about 
adenosquamous carcinomas, large cell carcinomas, and carcinoid 
tumors (see Principles of Pathologic Review in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). The purpose of the pathologic evaluation of NSCLC varies 
depending on whether the sample is 1) intended for initial diagnosis in a 
case of suspected NSCLC; 2) a definitive resection sample; or 3) 
obtained for molecular evaluation in the setting of an established NSCLC 
diagnosis. Further details are provided in the algorithm. All NSCLC 
should be classified according to subtype using the WHO Guidelines.73 
Major subtypes of NSCLC include adenocarcinoma, squamous cell 
carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, carcinoid 
tumor, and less common subtypes that are not discussed here. Ideally, 
the subtype should be specified. The general terms NSCC or NSCC 
NOS should be used infrequently and only when a more specific 
diagnosis cannot be obtained by morphology and/or special staining.  
Adenocarcinomas include AIS, MIA, invasive adenocarcinomas, and 
invasive adenocarcinoma variants (see Adenocarcinoma in this 
Discussion and the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Squamous cell 
carcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor that 1) shows either 
keratinization and/or intercellular bridges; or 2) is an undifferentiated 
NSCC that demonstrates positivity for squamous cell carcinoma markers 
by IHC. Adenosquamous carcinomas are tumors with mixed 
adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma components; each 
component comprises at least 10% of the tumor. The presence of any 
adenocarcinoma component in a biopsy specimen that is otherwise 
squamous should trigger molecular testing. Large cell carcinomas are 
tumors lacking morphologic or IHC evidence of clear lineage, with

negative or uninformative stains for squamous cell carcinoma and 
adenocarcinoma. The diagnosis of large cell carcinoma requires a 
thoroughly sampled resected tumor and cannot be made on 
non-resected or cytology specimens. Staining for large cell carcinomas 
should include mucin stain to look for occult glandular differentiation. 
Although carcinoid tumors are not treated like other types of NSCLC, 
they are staged in the same manner and are part of the differential 
diagnosis of pulmonary lesions (see the NCCN Guidelines for 
Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors, available at www.NCCN.org). Care 
should be taken to properly distinguish typical carcinoid from atypical 
carcinoid by assessing for necrosis and using a morphologic mitotic 
count.  
Adenocarcinoma  
As previously mentioned, most lung carcinomas are adenocarcinomas. In 
2011, the classification for lung adenocarcinoma was revised by an 
international panel and adopted by WHO.72-74 The revised classification 
recommends that use of general categories—NSCC and NSCC NOS—
should be minimized, because more effective treatment can be selected 
when the specific subtype is known; IHC and molecular studies are also 
recommended (see Principles of Pathologic Review in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).117  
The categories of BAC or mixed subtype adenocarcinoma are no longer 
used to classify adenocarcinoma.74 The categories for adenocarcinoma 
include: 1) AIS, which is a preinvasive, typically solitary lesion that is 
usually non-mucinous; 2) MIA, which is a solitary and discrete 
non-mucinous lesion with a maximum area of invasion no greater than 0.5 
cm; and 3) invasive adenocarcinoma (see the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). Both AIS and MIA are associated with excellent survival if they 
are resected. The terms AIS, MIA, and large cell carcinoma should not be 
used for small samples because of challenges with complete assessment 
of the lesion.74  
The international panel and the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommend that all 
patients with adenocarcinoma be tested for EGFR mutations; the NCCN 
NSCLC Panel also recommends that patients receive routine biomarker 
testing for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements (also 
known as ALK fusions), ROS1 rearrangements (also known as ROS1 
fusions), BRAF mutations, c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor 
(c-MET) exon 14 (METex14) skipping mutations, rearranged during 
transfection (RET) rearrangements, and programmed death ligand 1 
(PD-L1) expression levels, because FDA-approved agents for lung cancer 
are available for these biomarkers. Testing for other genetic variants may 
also be done—such as neurotrophin tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) 
gene fusions, MET amplification, and ERBB2 (also known as HER2) 
mutations—to identify these rare oncogenic driver variants for which 
effective therapy may be available, although there is less evidence to 
support testing (see Emerging Biomarkers to Identify Novel Therapies for 
Patients with Metastatic NSCLC in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).118-120 The NCCN NSCLC Panel also recommends PD-L1 IHC 
testing (category 1) in patients with metastatic NSCLC based on phase 3 
randomized trial data.121  
Immunohistochemical Staining  
Judicious use of IHC in small tissue samples to determine a diagnosis of 
NSCLC is strongly recommended to conserve tumor tissue for molecular 
studies, especially in patients with advanced disease (see Principles of 
Pathologic Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).110,122,123 Note that 
IHC analyses used to identify tumor type and lineage (eg, 
adenocarcinoma vs. squamous cell carcinoma) are distinct from IHC 
analyses used to determine whether patients are candidates for ALK 
inhibitor therapy or PD-L1 inhibitor therapy. Before using IHC to determine

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
 
MS-10 
histologic subtype, all material should be assessed morphologically, 
including routine staining approaches such as hematoxylin and eosin 
(H&E) histology (or relevant stains for cytology specimens), clinical 
findings, imaging studies, and the patient’s history. Cytology may be 
sufficient to distinguish adenocarcinomas from squamous cell 
carcinomas.124 If necessary, IHC should be used to distinguish 
adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, metastatic malignancy, and 
primary pleural mesothelioma (particularly for pleural samplings).122 IHC is 
useful for poorly differentiated NSCLC in small biopsy and/or cytology 
specimens.74,125 Squamous cell carcinomas are often TTF-1 negative and 
p40 (or alternatively p63) positive, whereas adenocarcinomas are usually 
TTF-1 positive.74 These 2 markers may be sufficient to distinguish 
adenocarcinomas from squamous cell carcinomas.74,125 Other markers 
(eg, p40, Napsin A) may also be useful in distinguishing adenocarcinoma 
from squamous cell carcinoma.126,127 Napsin A positivity occurs in more 
than 80% of lung adenocarcinomas. In small biopsy specimens previously 
classified as NSCC NOS, a panel of TTF-1 (or alternatively Napsin A) and 
p40 (or alternatively p63) may be sufficient to refine the diagnosis to either 
adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Note that p63 can co-stain 
with TTF-1 or Napsin A in adenocarcinoma.  
An appropriate panel of IHC stains should include those relevant for 
evaluation of metastatic carcinomas to the lung if the primary origin of the 
carcinoma is uncertain. It is appropriate to first perform a limited panel of 
IHC to evaluate for NSCLC and, if negative, then proceed to additional 
IHC for evaluation of possible metastasis from a distant site. TTF-1 is very 
important for distinguishing primary lung adenocarcinoma from metastatic 
adenocarcinoma, because most (70%–90%) non-mucinous primary 
adenocarcinomas are TTF-1 positive. TTF-1 is typically negative in 
squamous cell carcinoma.125 However, TTF-1 is also positive in tumors 
such as thyroid cancer and rarely in a few other organ systems.128 In 
addition, thyroglobulin and PAX8 are positive in tumors from patients with 
thyroid cancer, while they are negative in lung cancer tumors. 
Immunomarkers that may be useful to assess for metastatic carcinoma to 
the lung include breast carcinoma (ERα, PR, GCDFP-15, mammaglobin, 
GATA-3), renal cell carcinoma (PAX8), papillary serous carcinoma (PAX8, 
PAX2, ER), and adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract (CDX2) or 
prostate gland (NKX3.1). All typical and atypical carcinoid tumors are 
positive for chromogranin and synaptophysin, whereas SCLC is negative 
in 25% of cases.  
Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare disease.129,130 The NCCN 
NSCLC Panel feels that malignant mesothelioma and lung 
adenocarcinoma can be distinguished using clinical impression, imaging, 
and a limited panel of immunomarkers (if needed) to preserve tissue for 
molecular testing. Commonly used immunostains sensitive and specific 
for adenocarcinoma include pCEA, Claudin-4, TTF-1, and Napsin A 
(negative in mesothelioma). Other potentially useful markers include 
B72.3, Ber-EP4, MOC31, and CD15; however, these markers generally 
do not have the sensitivity and specificity of the commonly used markers. 
Immunostains sensitive and specific for mesothelioma include WT-1, 
calretinin, cytokeratin 5/6, and D2-40 (podoplanin antibody) (negative in 
adenocarcinoma).129-131 Broad epithelial markers such as keratin(s), as 
well as other lineage-specific markers, should be used when the 
differential diagnosis includes non-pulmonary and non-mesothelial 
lesions. Other markers can be useful in the differential diagnosis 
between mesothelioma and metastatic carcinoma to the lung (see 
Principles of Pathologic Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). 
Although the cytologic diagnosis of NSCLC is generally reliable, it is more 
difficult to diagnose SCLC (see the NCCN Guidelines for Small Cell Lung 
Cancer, available at www.NCCN.org).95,125,132 Many patients with SCLC 
have characteristic CT and clinical findings (eg, massive 
lymphadenopathy, mediastinal invasion). Most SCLCs are immunoreactive

for TTF-1; they are typically negative for CK34βE12 and p63.133,134 Many 
SCLCs also stain positively for markers of neuroendocrine differentiation, 
including chromogranin and synaptophysin. IHC should be used to confirm 
neuroendocrine differentiation only when appropriate morphologic 
features—speckled chromatin pattern, nuclear molding, and peripheral 
palisading—are present. NCAM (CD56), chromogranin, and 
synaptophysin are used to identify neuroendocrine tumors if morphologic 
suspicion of neuroendocrine differentiation exists. One positive marker is 
sufficient if the staining is not ambiguous in more than 10% of the tumor 
cells.  
Staging  
A revised edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (8th edition) was 
published in late 2016 and is effective for all cancer cases recorded on or 
after January 1, 2018.135,136 The lung cancer staging system was revised 
by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer 
(IASLC)137-139 and was adopted by the AJCC.135,136,140,141 The definitions 
for TNM and the stage grouping for the eighth edition are summarized in 
Tables 1 and 2 of the staging tables (see Definitions for T,N,M and 
Staging in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). The descriptors of the TNM 
classification scheme are summarized in Table 3 of the staging tables, 
which shows the differences between the seventh and eighth editions (see 
Staging).142 Early-stage disease is stages I and II with negative nodes 
(N0), whereas locally advanced disease is stages II and III with positive 
nodes (N+);143 advanced or metastatic disease is stage IV. Pathologic 
staging uses both clinical staging information (which is noninvasive and 
includes medical history, physical examination, and imaging) and other 
invasive staging procedures (eg, thoracotomy, examination of lymph 
nodes using mediastinoscopy).144  
From 2009 to 2015, the overall 5-year relative survival rate for NSCLC 
was 25% in the United States.3 Of NSCLC and bronchial cancer cases, 
19% were diagnosed while the cancer was still confined to the primary 
site; 24% were diagnosed after the cancer had spread to regional lymph 
nodes or directly beyond the primary site; 55% were diagnosed after the 
cancer had already metastasized; and for the remaining 2% the staging 
information was unknown. The corresponding 5-year relative survival rates 
were 61.4% for localized, 34.5% for regional, 6.1% for distant, and 14.6% 
for unstaged.3  
Five-year survival after lobectomy for pathologic stage I NSCLC ranges 
from 45% to 65%, depending on whether the patient has stage 1A or 1B 
disease and on the location of the tumor.145 Another study in patients with 
stage I disease (n = 19,702) found that 82% had surgical resection and 
their 5-year overall survival was 54%; for untreated stage I NSCLC, 5-year 
overall survival was only 6%.146 Of patients with stage I disease who 
refused surgery (although it was recommended), 78% died of lung cancer 
within 5 years.  
Predictive and Prognostic Biomarkers 
Several biomarkers have emerged as predictive and prognostic markers 
for NSCLC. A predictive biomarker is indicative of therapeutic efficacy, 
because there is an interaction between the biomarker and therapy on 
patient outcome. A prognostic biomarker is indicative of patient survival 
independent of the treatment received, because the biomarker is an 
indicator of the innate tumor behavior (see KRAS Mutations at the end of 
this section). The NSCLC Panel recommends testing for certain molecular 
and immune biomarkers in all appropriate patients with metastatic NSCLC 
to assess whether patients are eligible for targeted therapies or 
immunotherapies based on data showing improvement in overall survival 
for patients receiving targeted therapies or immunotherapies compared 
with traditional chemotherapy regimens.10-17

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
 
MS-12 
Predictive biomarkers include the ALK fusion oncogene (fusion between 
ALK and other genes [eg, echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 
4]), ROS1 gene fusions, sensitizing EGFR gene mutations, BRAF V600E 
point mutations, NTRK gene fusions, METex14 skipping mutations, RET 
rearrangements, and PD-L1 expression (see Principles of Molecular and 
Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Emerging 
predictive biomarkers include ERBB2 mutations, high-level MET 
amplifications, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) (see Emerging 
Biomarkers to Identify Novel Therapies for Patients with Metastatic 
NSCLC in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). The presence of EGFR exon 
19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations is predictive of treatment benefit 
from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) therapy (eg, osimertinib); 
therefore, these mutations are referred to as sensitizing EGFR mutations 
(see EGFR Mutations in this Discussion).147,148 The presence of EGFR 
exon 19 deletions (LREA) or exon 21 L858R mutations does not appear to 
be prognostic of survival for patients with NSCLC, independent of 
therapy.149  
ALK fusion oncogenes (ie, ALK gene fusions) and ROS1 fusions are 
predictive biomarkers that have been identified in a small subset of 
patients with NSCLC; both predict for benefit from targeted therapy such 
as crizotinib or ceritinib (see ALK Gene Rearrangements and ROS1 
Rearrangements in this Discussion and Principles of Molecular and 
Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Other gene 
fusions have recently been identified, such as ERBB2 (HER2) mutations 
that are susceptible to targeted therapies, particularly therapies currently 
under investigation in clinical trials (see Emerging Biomarkers to Identify 
Novel Therapies for Patients with Metastatic NSCLC in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).150-155  
Testing for ALK gene fusions and EGFR gene mutations is recommended 
(category 1 for both) in the NSCLC algorithm for patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous NSCLC or NSCLC NOS so that patients with these genetic 
variants can receive effective treatment with targeted agents (see 
Targeted Therapies in this Discussion and the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).156-160 Testing for ROS1 fusions and BRAF mutations (both are 
category 2A) is also recommended in the NCCN Guidelines for 
nonsquamous NSCLC or NSCLC NOS. Although rare, patients with ALK 
fusions or EGFR mutations can have mixed squamous cell histology.161,162 
Therefore, testing for ALK fusions and EGFR mutations can be considered 
in select patients with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma if they are 
never smokers, small biopsy specimens were used for testing, or mixed 
histology was reported. Data suggest that EGFR mutations occur in 
patients with adenosquamous carcinoma at a rate similar to 
adenocarcinoma, which is harder to discriminate from squamous cell 
carcinoma in small specimens.161 Thus, testing for EGFR mutations and 
ALK fusions is recommended in mixed squamous cell lung specimens that 
contain an adenocarcinoma component, such as adenosquamous NSCLC 
or in samples in which an adenocarcinoma component cannot be 
excluded.160 The incidence of EGFR mutations is very low in patients with 
pure squamous cell histology (<4%).163 Testing for ROS1 fusions or BRAF 
mutations is also recommended (category 2A) in patients with squamous 
cell carcinoma who have small biopsy specimens or mixed histology.  
For patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, the NCCN NSCLC 
Panel currently recommends that a minimum of the following biomarkers 
should be tested, including EGFR mutations, BRAF mutations, ALK 
fusions, ROS1 fusions, METex14 skipping mutations, RET 
rearrangements, and PD-L1 expression levels. This list of recommended 
biomarkers may be revised as new oncogenic driver variants are identified 
and new agents are approved. Patients with NSCLC may have other 
genetic variants (see Emerging Biomarkers to Identify Novel Therapies for 
Patients with Metastatic NSCLC in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).102,164,165 The NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC provide

recommendations for individual biomarkers that should be tested and 
recommend testing techniques but do not endorse any specific 
commercially available biomarker assays.166 Biomarker testing should be 
done at properly accredited laboratories (minimum of Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments [CLIA] accreditation) (see Principles of 
Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). 
EGFR, KRAS, ROS1, BRAF, METex14 skipping mutations, RET 
rearrangements, and ALK genetic variants do not usually overlap; thus, 
testing for KRAS mutations may identify patients who will not benefit from 
further molecular testing.150,167-171 The KRAS oncogene is a prognostic 
biomarker. The presence of KRAS mutations is prognostic of poor survival 
for patients with NSCLC when compared to the absence of KRAS 
mutations, independent of therapy (see KRAS Mutations in this 
Discussion).172 KRAS mutations are also predictive of lack of benefit from 
EGFR TKI therapy.147,173,174  
Other oncogenic driver variants are being identified such as high-level 
MET amplification, ERBB2 mutations, and TMB.175-178 TMB is an emerging 
biomarker that may be helpful for identifying patients with metastatic 
NSCLC who are eligible for first-line therapy with nivolumab with or without 
ipilimumab (see Nivolumab With or Without Ipilimumab in this 
Discussion).179,180 However, there is no consensus on how to measure 
TMB. Targeted agents are available for patients with NSCLC who have 
these other genetic variants, although they are FDA approved for other 
indications (see Emerging Biomarkers to Identify Novel Therapies for 
Patients with Metastatic NSCLC in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).181,182 Thus, the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends molecular 
testing but strongly advises broader molecular profiling to identify these 
other rare driver variants for which targeted therapies may be available to 
ensure that patients receive the most appropriate treatment; patients may 
be eligible for clinical trials for some of these targeted agents.159 Several 
online resources are available that describe NSCLC driver events such as 
My Cancer Genome.  
Information about biomarker testing and plasma cell-free/circulating tumor 
DNA testing (so-called “liquid biopsy”) for genetic variants is included in 
the algorithm (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Briefly, the panel feels that plasma 
cell-free/circulating tumor DNA testing should not be used to diagnose 
NSCLC; tissue should be used to diagnose NSCLC. Standards and 
guidelines for cell-free DNA (cfDNA)/circulating tumor DNA testing for 
genetic variants have not been established, there is up to a 30% 
false-negative rate, and variants can be detected that are not related to 
the tumor (eg, clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential 
[CHIP]).183,184 For example, an IDH1 mutation identified by cfDNA testing 
is likely unrelated to NSCLC, given exceptionally low incidence, and is 
more likely to represent CHIP. Rare examples of CHIP with KRAS 
mutations have been described, suggesting caution in the interpretation of 
cfDNA findings.185 In addition, CHIP can be identified following prior 
chemotherapy or radiotherapy, further confounding interpretation of 
variants such as in TP53.186 Given the previous caveats, careful 
consideration is required to determine whether cfDNA findings reflect a 
true oncogenic driver or an unrelated finding.  
However, cfDNA testing can be used in specific circumstances if 1) the 
patient is not medically fit for invasive tissue sampling, or 2) there is 
insufficient tissue for molecular analysis and follow-up tissue-based 
analysis will be done if an oncogenic driver is not identified.187,188 Recent 
data suggest that plasma cell-free/circulating tumor DNA testing can be 
used to identify EGFR, ALK, and other oncogenic biomarkers that would 
not otherwise be identified in patients with metastatic NSCLC.189-191

Testing for Molecular Biomarkers 
Molecular testing is used to test for genomic variants associated with 
oncogenic driver events for which targeted therapies are available; these 
genomic variants (also known as molecular biomarkers) include gene 
mutations and fusions. The various molecular testing methods that may be 
used to assess for the different biomarkers are described in the algorithm 
(see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). Broad molecular profiling systems may be used to 
simultaneously test for multiple biomarkers.  
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) (also known as massively parallel 
sequencing) is a type of broad molecular profiling system that can detect 
panels of mutations and gene fusions if the NGS platforms have been 
designed and validated to detect these genetic variants.181,192-199 It is 
important to recognize that NGS requires quality control as much as any 
other diagnostic technique; because it is primer dependent, the panel of 
genes and abnormalities detected with NGS will vary depending on the 
design of the NGS platform. For example, some NGS platforms can detect 
both mutations and gene fusions, as well as copy number variation, but 
they are not uniformly present in all NGS assays being conducted either 
commercially or in institutional laboratories.  
Other mutation screening assays are available for detecting multiple 
biomarkers simultaneously—such as Sequenom's MassARRAY® system 
and SNaPshot® Multiplex System—which can detect more than 50 point 
mutations; NGS platforms can detect even more biomarkers. However, 
these multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems do not typically 
detect gene fusions. ROS1 and ALK gene fusions can be detected using 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), NGS, and other methods (see 
ALK Gene Rearrangements and ROS1 Rearrangements in this Discussion 
and Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).  
To minimize tissue use and potential wastage, the NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends that broad molecular profiling be done as part of biomarker 
testing using a validated test(s) that assesses a minimum of the following 
potential genetic variants: EGFR mutations, BRAF mutations, METex14 
skipping mutations, RET rearrangements, ALK fusions, and ROS1 
fusions. Both FDA and laboratory-developed test platforms are available 
that address the need to evaluate these and other analytes. Broad 
molecular profiling is also recommended to identify rare driver mutations 
for which effective therapy may be available, such as NTRK gene 
fusions, high-level MET amplification, ERBB2 mutations, and TMB. 
Although clinicopathologic features—such as smoking status, ethnicity, 
and histology—are associated with specific genetic variants (eg, EGFR 
mutations), these features should not be used to select patients for 
testing. Although the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC provide 
recommendations for individual biomarkers that should be tested and 
recommend testing techniques, the guidelines do not endorse any 
specific commercially available biomarker assays.  
EGFR Mutations  
In patients with NSCLC, the most commonly found EGFR gene mutations 
are deletions in exon 19 (Exon19del [with conserved deletion of the LREA 
sequence] in 45% of patients with EGFR mutations) and a point mutation 
in exon 21 (L858R in 40%). Both mutations result in activation of the 
tyrosine kinase domain, and both are associated with sensitivity to the 
small-molecule EGFR TKIs, such as erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, 
osimertinib, and dacomitinib (see Targeted Therapies in this 
Discussion).200 Thus, these drug-sensitive EGFR mutations are referred to 
as sensitizing EGFR mutations. Other less common mutations (10%) that 
are also sensitive to EGFR TKIs include exon 19 insertions, p.L861Q, 
p.G719X, and p.S768I (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker 
Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).201,202 Data suggest that 
patients harboring tumors without sensitizing EGFR mutations should not

MS-15 
be treated with EGFR TKIs in any line of therapy. These sensitizing EGFR 
mutations are found in approximately 10% of Caucasian patients with 
NSCLC and up to 50% of Asian patients.203  
Most patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations are nonsmokers or former 
light smokers with adenocarcinoma histology. Data suggest that EGFR 
mutations can occur in patients with adenosquamous carcinoma, which is 
harder to discriminate from squamous cell carcinoma in small 
specimens.161 Patients with pure squamous cell carcinoma are unlikely to 
have sensitizing EGFR mutations; those with adenosquamous carcinoma 
may have mutations.161 However, smoking status, ethnicity, and histology 
should not be used in selecting patients for testing. EGFR mutation testing 
is not usually recommended in patients who appear to have squamous cell 
carcinoma unless they are a former light or never-smoker, if only a small 
biopsy specimen (ie, not a surgical resection) was used to assess 
histology, or if the histology is mixed.161 The ESMO Guidelines specify that 
only patients with nonsquamous NSCLC (eg, adenocarcinoma) should be 
assessed for EGFR mutations.159,204 ASCO recommends that patients be 
tested for EGFR mutations.205 
The predictive effects of the drug-sensitive EGFR mutations are well 
defined. Patients with these mutations have a significantly better response 
to erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, osimertinib, or dacomitinib.200 Data show that 
EGFR TKI therapy should be used as first-line monotherapy in patients 
with advanced NSCLC and sensitizing EGFR mutations documented 
before first-line systemic therapy (eg, carboplatin/paclitaxel) (see Targeted 
Therapies in this Discussion).206-211 Progression-free survival (PFS) is 
longer with use of EGFR TKI monotherapy in patients with sensitizing 
EGFR mutations when compared with cytotoxic systemic therapy, 
although overall survival is not statistically different.206,207,212  
Non-responsiveness to EGFR TKI therapy is associated with KRAS and 
BRAF mutations and ALK or ROS1 gene fusions. Patients with EGFR 
exon 20 insertion mutations are usually resistant to erlotinib, gefitinib, 
afatinib, or dacomitinib, although there are rare exceptions (see Principles 
of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).213-217 Patients typically progress after first-line EGFR TKI 
monotherapy; subsequent therapy recommendations are described in 
the algorithm [see Second-Line and Beyond (Subsequent) Systemic 
Therapy in this Discussion and the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC]. EGFR 
p.Thr790Met (T790M) is a mutation associated with acquired resistance 
to EGFR TKI therapy and has been reported in about 60% of patients with 
disease progression after initial response to erlotinib, gefitinib, or 
afatinib.197,218-224 Most patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations become 
resistant to erlotinib, gefitinib, or afatinib; PFS is about 9.7 to 13 
months.207,212,219,225,226 Studies suggest T790M may rarely occur in patients 
who have not previously received erlotinib, gefitinib, or afatinib.227 Genetic 
counseling is recommended for patients with pre-treatment p.T790M, 
because this suggests the possibility of germline mutation and is 
associated with predisposition to familial lung cancer.228,229 Acquired 
resistance to EGFR TKIs may also be associated with histologic 
transformation from NSCLC to SCLC and with epithelial to mesenchymal 
transition.230-233 For the 2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel 
suggests that a biopsy can be considered at progression to rule out SCLC 
transformation. Acquired resistance can also be mediated by other 
molecular events, such as acquisition of ALK rearrangement, MET, or 
ERBB2 amplification.234  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends testing for sensitizing EGFR 
mutations in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC or NSCLC 
NOS based on data showing the efficacy of osimertinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, 
afatinib, or dacomitinib and on FDA approvals (see Osimertinib, Erlotinib 
and Gefitinib, Afatinib, and Dacomitinib in this Discussion).206,208-211 DNA 
mutational analysis is the preferred method to assess for EGFR status; 
IHC is not recommended for detecting EGFR mutations.235-238 Real-time

PCR, Sanger sequencing (paired with tumor enrichment), and NGS are 
the most commonly used methods to assess EGFR mutation status (see 
Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines 
for NSCLC).160,235 Direct sequencing of DNA corresponding to exons 18 to 
21 (or just testing for exons 19 and 21) is a reasonable approach; 
however, more sensitive methods are available.203,237,239-241 Mutation 
screening assays using multiplex PCR (eg, Sequenom's MassARRAY® 
system, SNaPshot® Multiplex System) can simultaneously detect more 
than 50 point mutations.242 NGS can also be used to detect EGFR 
mutations.198 
Osimertinib is a preferred first-line EGFR TKI option for patients with 
EGFR positive metastatic NSCLC (see Osimertinib in this Discussion). For 
the 2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel preference stratified 
first-line therapy for patients with EGFR mutation positive metastatic 
NSCLC. Erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, or dacomitinib are “other 
recommended” EGFR TKI options for first-line therapy. Osimertinib is 
recommended (category 1) as second-line and beyond (subsequent) 
therapy for patients with EGFR T790M–positive metastatic NSCLC who 
have progressed on erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, or dacomitinib (see 
Osimertinib in this Discussion).226,243 Sensitizing EGFR mutations and 
ALK or ROS1 fusions are generally mutually exclusive.171,244,245 Thus, 
crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, or lorlatinib are not recommended 
as subsequent therapy for patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations who 
relapse on EGFR TKI therapy. The phrase subsequent therapy was 
recently substituted for the terms second-line or beyond systemic 
therapy, because the line of therapy may vary depending on previous 
treatment with targeted agents.  
BRAF V600E Mutations  
BRAF (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) is a 
serine/threonine kinase that is part of the MAP/ERK signaling pathway. 
BRAF V600E is the most common of the BRAF point mutations when 
considered across all tumor types; it occurs in 1% to 2% of patients with 
lung adenocarcinoma.168,246 Although other BRAF mutations occur in 
patients with NSCLC at a rate approximately equal to p.V600E (unlike 
many other tumor types), specific targeted therapy is not available for 
these other mutations. Patients with BRAF V600E mutations are typically 
current or former smokers in contrast to those with EGFR mutations or 
ALK fusions who are typically nonsmokers.247 Mutations in BRAF typically 
do not overlap with EGFR mutations, METex14 skipping mutations, RET 
rearrangements, ALK fusions, or ROS1 fusions.168,169 Testing for BRAF 
mutations is recommended (category 2A) in patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous NSCLC and may be considered in patients with squamous 
cell NSCLC (category 2A) if small biopsy specimens were used to assess 
histology or mixed histology was reported.168,169 Real-time PCR, Sanger 
sequencing, and NGS are the most commonly used methods to assess for 
BRAF mutations (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in 
the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends testing for BRAF mutations in 
patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC based on data showing the 
efficacy of dabrafenib plus trametinib for patients with BRAF V600E 
mutations and on the FDA approval (see Dabrafenib and Trametinib in this 
Discussion).168 For the 2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel 
preference stratified first-line therapy for patients with BRAF V600E 
mutation–positive metastatic NSCLC. Dabrafenib plus trametinib is 
recommended (category 2A; preferred) for patients with BRAF V600E 
mutations. If combination therapy with dabrafenib/trametinib is not 
tolerated, single-agent therapy with dabrafenib or vemurafenib are “other 
recommended” agents.168,169,248 Chemotherapy regimens also used for 
initial systemic therapy (eg, carboplatin/pemetrexed for nonsquamous 
NSCLC) and are “useful in certain circumstances.” Patients with BRAF 
mutations respond (24%) to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).249

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
 
MS-17 
ALK Gene Rearrangements  
About 5% of patients with NSCLC have ALK gene rearrangements (also 
known as ALK fusions).107 Patients with ALK fusions are resistant to EGFR 
TKIs but have similar clinical characteristics to those with EGFR 
mutations, such as adenocarcinoma histology and being light or never 
smokers.165 ALK fusions are not routinely found in patients with squamous 
cell carcinoma. Patients with ALK gene fusions can have mixed squamous 
cell histology.162,250 It can be challenging to accurately determine histology 
in small biopsy specimens; thus, patients may have mixed squamous cell 
histology (or squamous components) instead of pure squamous cell.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends testing for ALK fusions in patients 
with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC based on data showing the efficacy 
of alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, and crizotinib for ALK fusions and on the 
FDA approvals.251-254 If patients appear to have squamous cell NSCLC, 
then testing can be considered if small biopsy specimens were used to 
assess histology, mixed histology was reported, or patients are light or 
never-smokers. The different testing methods for ALK fusions are 
described in the algorithm (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker 
Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). A molecular diagnostic 
FISH test has been approved by the FDA for detecting ALK fusions. Rapid 
prescreening with IHC to assess for ALK fusions can be done.160,171,255-262 
An IHC assay for ALK fusions has also been approved by the FDA. NGS 
can also be used to assess whether ALK fusions are present, if the 
platform has been appropriately designed and validated to detect ALK 
fusions.263-265  
Alectinib is recommended as a preferred first-line therapy for patients with 
ALK rearrangement–positive metastatic NSCLC (see Alectinib in this 
Discussion). For the 2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel preference 
stratified first-line therapy with brigatinib, ceritinib, or crizotinib for patients 
with ALK rearrangement–positive metastatic NSCLC. Brigatinib and 
ceritinib are “other recommended” options, whereas crizotinib is “useful 
in certain circumstances” (see Brigatinib, Ceritinib, and Crizotinib in this 
Discussion). Patients with ALK rearrangements do not respond to ICIs.249 
Patients typically progress after first-line therapy with alectinib, brigatinib, 
crizotinib, or ceritinib; subsequent therapy recommendations are 
described in the algorithm [see Second-Line and Beyond (Subsequent) 
Systemic Therapy in this Discussion and the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC]. ALK or ROS1 fusions, RET rearrangements, BRAF mutations, 
METex14 skipping mutations, and sensitizing EGFR mutations are 
generally mutually exclusive.171,244,245 Specific targeted therapy for RET 
rearrangements, BRAF mutations, METex14 skipping mutations, and 
sensitizing EGFR mutations is not recommended as subsequent therapy 
in patients with ALK or ROS1 fusions who relapse on alectinib, brigatinib, 
crizotinib, ceritinib, or lorlatinib (see ALK Positive: Subsequent Therapy 
in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).164,165  
ROS1 Rearrangements  
Although ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1) is a distinct receptor tyrosine 
kinase, it is very similar to ALK and members of the insulin receptor family 
(see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).151,266 It is estimated that ROS1 gene 
rearrangements (also known as ROS1 fusions) occur in about 1% to 2% of 
patients with NSCLC; they occur more frequently in those who are 
negative for EGFR mutations, KRAS mutations, and ALK gene 
fusions.118,151,153,267 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends ROS1 testing 
(category 2A) in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC or NSCLC 
NOS based on data showing the efficacy of crizotinib, ceritinib, and 
entrectinib for patients with ROS1 fusions (see Principles of Molecular and 
Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).150,151,268,269 ROS1 
testing can be considered in patients with metastatic squamous cell 
NSCLC if small biopsy specimens were used to assess histology or mixed

MS-18 
histology was reported. Similar to testing for ALK fusions, testing for ROS1 
fusions is done using FISH.153,255,270-272 NGS can also be used to assess 
whether ROS1 fusions are present, if the platform has been appropriately 
designed and validated to detect ROS1 fusions.151 Clinicians should use 
an appropriately validated test to detect ROS1 fusions.269  
Crizotinib is very effective for patients with ROS1 fusions with response 
rates of about 70% to 80% including complete responses.14,150,151,273,274 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends crizotinib, entrectinib, or ceritinib 
(all are category 2A) as first-line therapy options for patients with 
ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial data (see 
Crizotinib, Entrectinib, and Ceritinib in this Discussion). The NCCN 
NSCLC Panel voted that crizotinib and entrectinib are the preferred 
first-line therapy options for patients with ROS1-positive metastatic 
NSCLC because they are better tolerated, have been assessed in more 
patients, and are approved by the FDA (see Crizotinib and Entrectinib in 
this Discussion).268,269,275,276 Although entrectinib has better CNS 
penetration than crizotinib, it is more toxic. If ROS1 fusions are 
discovered during first-line systemic therapy (eg, carboplatin/paclitaxel), 
then the planned therapy may be either completed or interrupted followed 
by crizotinib (preferred), entrectinib (preferred), or ceritinib.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends lorlatinib (category 2A) as a 
subsequent therapy option for select patients with ROS1-positive 
metastatic NSCLC who have progressed after treatment with crizotinib, 
entrectinib, or ceritinib (see Lorlatinib in this Discussion).277 Initial systemic 
therapy options that are used for adenocarcinoma or squamous cell 
carcinoma are also an option in this setting (eg, carboplatin/paclitaxel). 
Patients with ROS1 rearrangements have a slight response (17%) to 
ICIs.249 Alectinib, brigatinib, and ceritinib are not recommended in patients 
with ROS1 fusions whose disease becomes resistant to crizotinib.151 
Studies are ongoing regarding new agents for patients with ROS1 fusions 
whose disease becomes resistant to crizotinib, ceritinib, or 
entrectinib.278-281 The phrase subsequent therapy was recently substituted 
for the terms second-line or beyond systemic therapy, because the line of 
therapy may vary depending on previous treatment with targeted agents.  
NTRK Gene Fusions 
NTRK gene fusions encode tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) fusion 
proteins (eg, TRKA, TRKB, TRKC) that act as oncogenic drivers for solid 
tumors including lung, salivary gland, thyroid, and sarcoma.282-284 A 
diverse range of solid tumors in children and adults may be caused by 
NTRK gene fusions (eg, NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3). It is estimated that 
NTRK fusions occur in 0.2% of patients with NSCLC and do not typically 
overlap with other oncogenic drivers such as EGFR, ALK, or ROS1.283 
Various methods can be used to detect NTRK gene fusions, including 
FISH, IHC, NGS, and PCR assays (see Principles of Molecular and 
Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). DNA-based 
NGS may not detect some NTRK1 and NTRK3 fusions; RNA-based NGS 
may be considered to assess for fusions.285 In a clinical trial, NTRK gene 
fusions were detected with NGS (50 patients) and FISH (5 patients).284 
Larotrectinib and entrectinib are oral TKIs that inhibit TRK across a diverse 
range of solid tumors in younger and older patients with NTRK gene–
fusion positive disease.276,284  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends NTRK gene fusion testing in 
patients with metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial data showing the 
efficacy of larotrectinib and entrectinib for patients with NTRK gene 
fusion–positive disease; however, clinical data are limited in NSCLC to 
support this recommendation.284,286,287 The NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends larotrectinib and entrectinib (both are category 2A) as either 
first-line or subsequent therapy options for patients with NTRK gene 
fusion–positive metastatic NSCLC based on data and the FDA approvals 
(see Larotrectinib and Entrectinib in this Discussion).275,276,286,288 For the

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
 
MS-19 
2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel voted that larotrectinib and 
entrectinib are both preferred (category 2A) as first-line therapy for 
patients with NTRK gene fusion–positive metastatic disease. A new 
section about NTRK fusions was also added to the algorithm (see 
Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines 
for NSCLC). For example, if NRTK1/2/3 testing was not included as part of 
a broad upfront panel, then NTRK1/2/3 testing can be considered if the 
patient’s tumor is negative for the main oncogenic drivers (ie, pan-negative 
for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF drivers).  
METex14 Skipping Mutations  
C-MET, the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, is a tyrosine kinase 
receptor that is involved in cell survival and proliferation; oncogenic driver 
genomic alterations in MET include METex14 skipping mutations, MET 
gene copy number (GCN) gain or amplification, and MET protein 
overexpression.167 MET genomic alterations do not typically overlap with 
EGFR, ROS1, BRAF, and ALK genetic variants.289 However, METex14 
skipping mutations and MET amplification may occur together. METex14 
skipping mutations occur in 3% to 4% of patients with adenocarcinomas 
NSCLC and 1% to 2% of patients with other NSCLC histologies.290,291 
METex14 skipping mutations are more frequent in older women who are 
nonsmokers.292  
Several different types of METex14 skipping mutations may occur, such 
as mutations, base substitutions, and deletions, which makes it difficult to 
test for all of the mutations. NGS and RT-PCR assays can be used to 
detect METex14 skipping mutations and MET amplification. Patients with 
METex14 skipping mutations have a modest response (16%) to 
immunotherapy, even those with high PD-L1 levels.249,293 
For the 2020 update (Version 4), the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
testing for METex14 skipping mutations (category 2A) in eligible patients 
with metastatic NSCLC based on data showing the efficacy of several 
agents for patients with METex14 skipping mutations and on the FDA 
approval for capmatinib (see Oral TKIs that Inhibit MET Exon 14 Skipping 
Mutations in this Discussion).294,295  
RET Rearrangements 
RET is a tyrosine kinase receptor that affects cell proliferation and 
differentiation. Rearrangements (fusions) may occur in NSCLC between 
the RET gene and other domains, especially kinesin family 5B (KIF5B) 
and coiled coil domain containing-6 (CCDC6), which lead to 
overexpression of the RET protein.296,297 RET rearrangements occur in 
about 1% to 2% of patients with NSCLC and are more frequent in patients 
with adenocarcinoma histology.155,296-299 In European patients, RET 
rearrangements occur in both smokers and nonsmokers.298 RET 
rearrangements do not typically overlap with EGFR, ROS1, BRAF, 
METex14 skipping, and ALK genetic variants.297 However, a few studies 
suggest that RET rearrangements may infrequently overlap with EGFR 
and KRAS mutations.300,301 FISH, RT-PCR, and NGS assays can be used 
to detect RET rearrangements.297 Patients with RET rearrangements have 
minimal response (6%) to immunotherapy.249  
For the 2020 update (Versions 4 and 7), the NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends testing for RET rearrangements (category 2A) in eligible 
patients with metastatic NSCLC based on data showing the efficacy of 
several agents for patients with RET rearrangements and on the FDA 
approvals for selpercatinib (LOXO-292) and pralsetinib (see Oral TKIs 
that Inhibit RET Rearrangements in this Discussion).152,302-304  
KRAS Mutations  
KRAS is a G-protein with GTPase activity that is part of the MAP/ERK 
pathway; point mutations in KRAS most commonly occur at codon 12. 
Data suggest that approximately 25% of patients with adenocarcinomas in 
a North American population have KRAS mutations; KRAS is the most 
common mutation in this population.105,147,174,181,182 KRAS mutation

prevalence is associated with cigarette smoking.305 Patients with KRAS 
mutations appear to have a shorter survival than patients with wild-type 
KRAS; therefore, KRAS mutations are prognostic biomarkers.172,174,306 
KRAS mutational status is also predictive of lack of therapeutic efficacy 
with EGFR TKIs; it does not appear to affect chemotherapeutic 
efficacy.105,147,173 KRAS mutations do not generally overlap with EGFR, 
ROS1, BRAF, and ALK genetic variants.150,168-171,307 Therefore, KRAS 
testing may identify patients who may not benefit from further molecular 
testing.159,173 KRAS mutations may infrequently overlap with EGFR 
mutations and RET rearrangements.300,301 Targeted therapy is not 
currently available for patients with KRAS mutations, although immune 
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) appear to be effective.249,308  
Testing for Immune Biomarkers: PD-L1 Expression Levels  
Human ICI antibodies inhibit the PD-1 receptor or PD-L1, which improves 
antitumor immunity; PD-1 receptors are expressed on activated cytotoxic 
T cells (see Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in this Discussion).309-311 
Nivolumab and pembrolizumab inhibit PD-1 receptors.121,312 Atezolizumab 
and durvalumab inhibit PD-L1.313,314 The NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends (category 1) IHC testing for PD-L1 expression ideally before 
first-line treatment (if clinically feasible) in all patients with metastatic 
NSCLC to assess whether the ICI regimens are an option based on 
clinical data showing the efficacy of these regimens (see Pembrolizumab 
in this Discussion).121,315  
The FDA-approved companion diagnostic test for PD-L1 expression is 
based on tumor proportion score (TPS) and used to determine usage of 
pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic NSCLC. TPS is the percentage 
of viable tumor cells showing partial or complete membrane staining at 
any intensity. Testing for PD-L1 is not required for prescribing first-line 
therapy with the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy regimens or for 
subsequent therapy with single-agent nivolumab or atezolizumab. 
Although it is not an optimal biomarker, PD-L1 expression is currently the 
best available biomarker to assess whether patients are candidates for 
PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors (ICIs; also known as immuno-oncology [IO] 
agents, immunotherapy).316,317 PD-L1 expression is continuously variable 
and dynamic; thus, a cutoff value for a positive result is artificial. Patients 
with PD-L1 expression levels just below and just above 50% will probably 
have similar responses.316 Unique anti-PD-L1 IHC assays have been 
developed for each one of the different ICIs.316,318-320 The definition of a 
positive PD-L1 test result varies depending on which biomarker assay is 
used.320 Extensive effort has been undertaken to examine the 
cross-comparability of different clones with regard to each other to 
facilitate adoption of testing.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel emphasizes that clinicians should obtain 
molecular testing results for actionable biomarkers before administering 
first-line ICI therapy, if clinically feasible. Therefore, for the 2020 update 
(Version 1), the panel deleted “or unknown” regarding test results for 
certain actionable molecular biomarkers before administering PD-1 or 
PD-L1 inhibitors. Patients with metastatic NSCLC and PD-L1 expression 
levels of 1% or more—but who also have a targetable driver oncogene 
molecular variant (eg, EGFR, ALK, ROS1)—should receive first-line 
targeted therapy for that oncogene and not first-line ICIs because targeted 
therapies yield higher response rates (eg, osimertinib, 80%) than ICIs 
(poor response rates) in the first-line setting, targeted therapy is better 
tolerated, and these patients are unlikely to respond to ICIs.249,321-324 For 
the 2020 updates (Versions 1 and 4), the NCCN NSCLC Panel also 
deleted “or unknown” regarding test results for PD-L1 expression levels; 
the panel also added “ROS1 and RET fusions” along with “BRAF and MET 
exon 14 skipping mutations” to the list of actionable biomarkers that need 
to be negative before administering PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors.183 At a 
minimum, EGFR and ALK status should be known before starting 
systemic therapy with ICI regimens; however, it is ideal if ROS1, BRAF,

RET, and MET exon 14 status are also known. If it is not feasible to do 
molecular testing, then patients are treated as though they do not have 
driver oncogenes.  
Treatment Approaches  
Surgery, RT, and systemic therapy are the 3 modalities most commonly 
used to treat patients with NSCLC. They can be used either alone or in 
combination depending on the disease status. In the following sections, 
the clinical trials are described that have led to the recommended 
treatments. For tools to aid optimal assessment and management of 
older adults, see the NCCN Guidelines for Older Adult Oncology 
(available at www.NCCN.org). Older adults may be at risk for 
treatment-related adverse events.325  
Surgery 
In general, surgery provides the best chance for cure in patients with stage 
I or II disease.326 Thoracic surgical oncology consultation should be part of 
the evaluation of any patient being considered for curative local therapy. 
The overall plan of treatment and the necessary imaging studies should be 
determined before any nonemergency treatment is initiated. It is essential 
to determine whether patients can tolerate surgery or whether they are 
medically inoperable; some patients deemed inoperable may be able to 
tolerate minimally invasive surgery and/or sublobar resection.326-330 
Although frailty is an increasingly recognized predictor of surgical and 
other treatment morbidity, a preferred frailty assessment system has not 
been established.331-333  
The Principles of Surgical Therapy are described in the NSCLC algorithm 
and are summarized here (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). 
Determination of resectability, surgical staging, and pulmonary resection 
should be performed by thoracic surgeons who should participate in 
multidisciplinary clinics and/or tumor boards for patients with lung cancer. 
Surgery may be appropriate for select patients with uncommon types of 
lung cancer (eg, superior sulcus, chest wall involvement) (see the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).334 Patients with pathologic stage II or greater 
disease can be referred to a medical oncologist for evaluation. For 
patients with stage IIIA NSCLC that is deemed resectable, consider 
referral to a radiation oncologist. Treatment delays, because of poor 
coordination among specialists, should be avoided.  
The surgical procedure used depends on the extent of disease and on the 
cardiopulmonary reserve of the patient. Lung-sparing anatomic resection 
(sleeve lobectomy) is preferred over pneumonectomy, if anatomically 
appropriate and if margin-negative resection can be achieved; lobectomy 
or pneumonectomy should be done if physiologically feasible.326,335,336 
Sublobular resection, either segmentectomy (preferred) or wedge 
resection, is appropriate in select patients; the parenchymal resection 
margins are defined in the NSCLC algorithm (see Principles of Surgical 
Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).337-341 Resection (including 
wedge resection) is preferred over ablation.326,336 Wide wedge resection 
may improve outcomes.342 Patients with medically inoperable early-stage 
NSCLC may be candidates for SABR, also known as stereotactic body RT 
(SBRT).343,344 If SABR is considered for patients at high risk, a 
multidisciplinary evaluation is recommended (see Stereotactic Ablative 
Radiotherapy in this Discussion).345-347 
Lymph Node Dissection  
The ACOSOG Z0030 randomized trial compared systematic mediastinal 
lymph node sampling versus complete lymphadenectomy during 
pulmonary resection in patients with NSCLC who had either N0 (no 
demonstrable metastasis to regional lymph nodes) or N1 (metastasis to 
lymph nodes in the ipsilateral peribronchial and/or hilar region, including 
direct extension) disease. In patients with early-stage NSCLC who had 
negative nodes by systematic lymph node dissection, complete

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
 
MS-22 
mediastinal lymph node dissection did not improve survival.348,349 Thus, 
systematic lymph node sampling is appropriate during pulmonary 
resection; one or more nodes should be sampled from all mediastinal 
stations. For right-sided cancers, an adequate mediastinal 
lymphadenectomy should include stations 2R, 4R, 7, 8, and 9. For 
left-sided cancers, stations 4L, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 should be sampled.348 
Patients should have N1 and N2 node resection and mapping (American 
Thoracic Society map) with a minimum of 3 N2 stations sampled or a 
complete lymph node dissection.135 The lymph node map from the IASLC 
may be useful.350 Formal ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node dissection is 
indicated for patients undergoing resection for stage IIIA (N2) disease. For 
patients undergoing sublobular resection, the appropriate N1 and N2 
lymph node stations should be sampled unless not technically feasible 
because sampling would substantially increase the surgical risk.  
Sublobular resection, either segmentectomy (preferred) or wedge 
resection, is appropriate in select patients (see Principles of Surgical 
Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC): 1) those who are not 
eligible for lobectomy; and 2) those with a peripheral nodule 2 cm or less 
with very low-risk features. Segmentectomy (preferred) or wedge resection 
should achieve parenchymal resection margins that are: 1) 2 cm or more; 
or 2) the size of the nodule or larger.  
Thorascopic Lobectomy  
Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS), which is also known as 
thorascopic lobectomy, is a minimally invasive surgical treatment that is 
currently being investigated in all aspects of lung cancer (see Principles of 
Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).351,352 Published 
studies suggest that thorascopic lobectomy has several advantages over 
thoracotomy.353-357 Acute and chronic pain associated with thorascopic 
lobectomy is minimal; thus, this procedure requires a shorter length of 
hospitalization.358,359 Thorascopic lobectomy is also associated with low 
postoperative morbidity and mortality, minimal risk of intraoperative 
bleeding, or minimal locoregional recurrence.360-364 Thoracoscopic 
lobectomy is associated with less morbidity, fewer complications, and 
more rapid return to function than lobectomy by thoracotomy.365-368  
In patients with stage I NSCLC who had thorascopic lobectomy with lymph 
node dissection, the 5-year survival rate, long-term survival, and local 
recurrence rate were comparable to those achieved by routine open lung 
resection.369-373 Thorascopic lobectomy has also been shown to improve 
discharge independence in older populations and patients at high 
risk.374,375 Data show that thorascopic lobectomy improves the ability of 
patients to complete postoperative chemotherapy regimens.376,377 Based 
on its favorable effects on postoperative recovery and morbidity, 
thorascopic lobectomy (including robotic-assisted approaches) is 
recommended in the NSCLC algorithm as an acceptable approach for 
patients who are surgically resectable (and have no anatomic or surgical 
contraindications) as long as principles of thoracic surgery are not 
compromised (see Principles of Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines 
for NSCLC).378-381 Robotic VATS seems to be more expensive with longer 
operating times than conventional VATS.382,383  
Stage IIIA N2 Disease 
The role of surgery in patients with pathologically documented stage IIIA 
(N2) disease is described in the NSCLC algorithm (see Principles of 
Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC) and summarized 
here. Before treatment, it is essential to carefully evaluate for N2 disease 
using radiologic and invasive staging (ie, EBUS-guided procedures, 
mediastinoscopy, thorascopic procedures) and to discuss whether surgery 
is appropriate in a multidisciplinary team, which should include a thoracic 
surgeon.384,385 Randomized controlled trials suggest that surgery does not 
increase survival in these patients.386,387 However, one of these trials 
(EORTC) only enrolled patients with unresectable disease.387 Most

MS-23 
clinicians agree that resection is appropriate for patients with negative 
preoperative mediastinal nodes and with a single positive node (<3 cm) 
found at thoracotomy.388 Neoadjuvant (preoperative) therapy is 
recommended for select patients. The optimal timing of RT in trimodality 
therapy (preoperative with chemotherapy or postoperative) is not 
established and controversial.389,390 In patients with N2 disease, 50% of 
the NCCN Member Institutions use preoperative chemoradiotherapy 
whereas 50% use preoperative chemotherapy.391,392 There is no evidence 
that adding RT to induction regimens improves outcomes for patients with 
stage IIIA (N2) disease when compared with using chemotherapy alone.390 
Clinicians also agree that resection is not appropriate for patients with 
multiple pathologically proven malignant lymph nodes greater than 3 cm; 
definitive chemoradiotherapy is recommended for these patients.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel believes that surgery may be appropriate for 
select patients with N2 disease, especially those whose disease responds 
to induction chemotherapy (see Principles of Surgical Therapy in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).384,393 It is controversial whether 
pneumonectomy after preoperative chemoradiotherapy is 
appropriate.386,393-399 Patients with resectable stage IIIA (N2) disease 
should not be excluded from surgery, because some of them may have 
long-term survival or may be cured.393,400 For the 2020 update (Version 1), 
the NCCN NSCLC panel deleted the recommendation for postoperative 
chemotherapy in patients with T1–3 (other than invasive) N2 disease 
receiving induction chemotherapy with or without RT. 
Radiation Therapy  
The Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NSCLC algorithm include the 
following: 1) general principles for early-stage, locally advanced, and 
advanced/metastatic NSCLC; 2) target volumes, prescription doses, and 
normal tissue dose constraints for early-stage, locally advanced, and 
advanced/metastatic NSCLC; and 3) RT simulation, planning, and 
delivery.401-406 These RT principles are summarized in this section. Whole 
brain RT and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases are 
also discussed in this section. The RT abbreviations are defined in the 
NSCLC algorithm (see Table 1 in Principles of Radiation Therapy in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Recently, the NCCN NSCLC Panel 
extensively revised the RT recommendations in the algorithm (see 
Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). For 
example, some of the normal tissue dose constraints for conventionally 
fractionated RT were revised based on the biomedical literature (see 
Table 5).407-412  
General Principles 
Treatment recommendations should be made by a multidisciplinary team. 
Because RT has a potential role in all stages of NSCLC, as either 
definitive or palliative therapy, input from radiation oncologists who 
perform lung cancer RT as a prominent part of their practice should be 
part of the multidisciplinary evaluation for all patients with NSCLC. Uses of 
RT for NSCLC include: 1) definitive therapy for locally advanced NSCLC, 
generally combined with chemotherapy; 2) definitive therapy for 
early-stage NSCLC in patients with contraindications for surgery; 3) 
preoperative or postoperative therapy for selected patients treated with 
surgery; 4) therapy for limited recurrences and metastases; and/or 5) 
palliative therapy for patients with incurable NSCLC.347,413-420 The goals of 
RT are to maximize tumor control and to minimize treatment toxicity. 
Advanced technologies such as 4D-conformal RT simulation, 
intensity-modulated RT/volumetric modulated arc therapy (IMRT/VMAT), 
image-guided RT, motion management strategies, and proton therapy 
have been shown to reduce toxicity and increase survival in 
nonrandomized trials.421-427 A secondary analysis of the RTOG 0617 
randomized trial reported that 2-year overall survival, PFS, local failure, 
and distant metastasis-free survival were not significantly different for 
IMRT when compared with 3D-conformal RT. IMRT yielded lower rates of

severe pneumonitis when compared with 3D-conformal RT (3.5% vs. 
7.9%; P = .039).428 CT-planned 3D-conformal RT is now considered to be 
the minimum level.  
Radiation Simulation, Planning, and Delivery  
Simulation should be performed using CT scans obtained in the RT 
treatment position. Intravenous contrast CT scans, with or without oral 
contrast, are recommended for better target delineation whenever 
possible, especially in patients with central tumors or nodal involvement. 
FDG PET/CT can significantly improve target delineation accuracy, 
especially when there is atelectasis or contraindications to intravenous CT 
contrast.429,430 Ideally, PET/CT should be obtained 4 weeks before 
treatment because of the potential for rapid progression of NSCLC.431,432 In 
the NSCLC algorithm, recommendations are provided for patients 
receiving chemoradiation (including those with compromised lung or 
cardiac function), photon beams, or IMRT (see Radiation Therapy 
Simulation, Planning, and Delivery in the Principles of Radiation Therapy 
in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).426,433-436 Respiratory motion should 
be managed. The report from the AAPM Task Group 76 is a useful 
reference for implementing a broad range of motion management 
strategies as described in the NSCLC algorithm (see Radiation Therapy 
Simulation, Planning, and Delivery in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).437  
Target Volumes, Prescription Doses, and Normal Tissue Dose Constraints  
Commonly used prescription RT (or SABR) doses and normal tissue dose 
constraints are summarized in the Principles of Radiation Therapy in the 
NSCLC algorithm (see Tables 2–5 in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).402,404,417,438-443 Reports 50, 62, and 83 from the International 
Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements provide a formalism 
for defining RT target volumes based on grossly visible disease, potential 
microscopic extension, and margins for target motion and daily positioning 
uncertainty;444,445 the ACR Practice Parameters and Technical Standards 
are also a helpful reference.423,446,447 It is essential to evaluate the 
dose-volume histogram (DVH) of critical structures and to limit the doses 
to the organs at risk (such as spinal cord, lungs, heart, esophagus, and 
brachial plexus) to minimize normal tissue toxicity (see Table 5 in 
Principles of Radiation Therapy).448 For patients receiving postoperative 
RT (also known as PORT), stricter DVH parameters should be considered 
for the lungs. The QUANTEC review provides the most comprehensive 
estimates from clinical data of dose-response relationships for normal 
tissue complications.449-453  
Recently, some of the normal tissue dose constraints for conventionally 
fractionated RT were revised based on a survey of radiation oncologists at 
NCCN Member Institutions (see Table 5 in Principles of Radiation Therapy 
in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).407-412 These constraints are mainly 
empirical and have not, for the most part, been validated 
rigorously.411,438,454-459 Therefore, the doses and constraints provided in the 
tables are not specific prescriptive recommendations; they are useful 
reference doses that have been commonly used or are from previous 
clinical trials. A caveat was also added that these constraints represent 
doses that generally should not be exceeded. Because the risk of toxicity 
increases progressively with dose to normal tissues, a key principle of 
radiation treatment planning is to keep normal tissue doses "as low as 
reasonably achievable" while adequately covering the target. The doses to 
any given organ at risk should typically be lower than these constraints, 
approaching them only when there is close proximity to the target volume. 
After surgery, lung tolerance to RT is much less than for patients with 
intact lungs; therefore, more conservative constraints should be used for 
postoperative RT.  
For definitive RT, the commonly prescribed dose is 60 to 70 Gy in 2 Gy 
fractions over 6 to 7 weeks (see Principles of Radiation Therapy in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).460,461 RTOG 0617, a phase 3 randomized

trial, suggests that high-dose radiation using 74 Gy with concurrent 
chemotherapy does not improve survival, and might be harmful, when 
compared with a dose of 60 Gy.408,462-466 Although optimal RT dose 
intensification remains a valid question, at higher RT doses, normal tissue 
constraints become even more important.464 Although the RT dose to the 
heart was decreased in the RTOG 0617 trial, survival was decreased; 
thus, more stringent constraints may be appropriate.466-472 The NCCN 
Panel does not currently recommend a high dose of 74 Gy for routine 
use.463,465,466,468-475  
General Treatment Information 
The RT recommendations for patients with stages I to IV are described in 
the NSCLC algorithm (see Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).  
Definitive RT, particularly SABR, is recommended for patients with 
early-stage NSCLC (ie, stage I–II, N0) who are medically inoperable or 
those who refuse surgery (see Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy in this 
Discussion).343,344,347,420,476,477 Image-guided thermal ablation is an option 
for selected patients who are medically inoperable or those who need 
definitive local therapy.326,478-482 By extrapolation from surgical data, 
chemotherapy may be considered after definitive RT/SABR in patients 
with high-risk factors for recurrence (eg, large tumors >4 cm in size); for 
the 2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel revised the 
chemotherapy recommendation to category 2A from 2B.345,483 SABR is 
also an option for patients at high surgical risk who cannot tolerate a 
lobectomy (eg, major medical comorbidity or severely limited lung 
function). Resection is recommended for patients with early-stage NSCLC 
who are medically fit (see Principles of Surgical Therapy in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).484 The indications for using preoperative or 
postoperative chemoradiation or RT alone are described in the NSCLC 
algorithm (see Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). In patients with clinical stage I or II NSCLC who are upstaged 
to N2+ after surgery, postoperative chemotherapy can be administered 
followed by postoperative RT depending on the margin status (see the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Postoperative RT has been associated 
with increased mortality in patients with pathologic stage N0 to 1 
disease, although the study used older RT techniques.485  
Definitive chemoradiation is recommended for patients with stage II to III 
disease who are not appropriate surgical candidates.486 For patients with 
locally advanced NSCLC (stage III), the most commonly prescribed 
conventionally fractionated doses for definitive RT are 60 to 70 Gy in 2 
Gy fractions. Doses of at least 60 Gy should be given.487 Dose escalation 
is associated with better survival in non-randomized comparisons in RT 
alone, sequential chemo/RT, or concurrent chemo/RT.468,475,488 A 
meta-analysis demonstrated improved survival with accelerated 
fractionation RT regimens.489 Involved-field RT (also known as 
involved-field irradiation or IFI) is an option for treating nodal disease in 
patients with locally advanced NSCLC; IFI may offer advantages over 
elective nodal irradiation (ENI).490-497 
The optimal management of patients with potentially operable stage IIIA 
(N2) NSCLC is controversial and is discussed in detail in the algorithm 
(see Principles of Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).384,386,398,498 For patients undergoing preoperative therapy before 
surgical resection of stage IIIA NSCLC, some oncologists prefer 
chemotherapy alone rather than chemoradiotherapy for the preoperative 
treatment;390 RT should generally be given postoperatively if not given 
preoperatively.499 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends a preoperative 
RT dose of 45 to 54 Gy in 1.8 to 2 Gy fractions.389,500 Definitive RT doses 
delivered as preoperative chemo/RT can safely be administered and 
achieve promising nodal clearance and survival rates;441-443,501 the risk of 
surgical complications after high-dose RT can be minimized with expert

thoracic surgical techniques. NCCN Member Institutions are split evenly 
in their use of preoperative chemotherapy versus preoperative 
chemoradiation in patients with stage IIIA N2 NSCLC.384 Similarly, some 
consider the need for pneumonectomy to be a contraindication to a 
combined modality surgical approach given the excess mortality 
observed in clinical trials,386 but NCCN Member Institutions are split on 
this practice as well.  
In postoperative RT, the clinical target volume (CTV) includes the 
bronchial stump and high-risk draining lymph node stations.502 Standard 
doses after complete resection are 50 to 54 Gy in 1.8 to 2 Gy fractions, 
but a boost may be administered to high-risk regions including areas of 
nodal extracapsular extension or microscopic positive margins.403,503,504 
Lung dose constraints should be more conservative, because tolerance 
appears to be reduced after surgery. The European LungART trial 
provides useful guidelines for postoperative RT technique.505 Surgery is 
associated with potentially greater risk of complications, particularly 
stump breakdown and bronchopleural fistula, in a field that has had 
high-dose RT (eg, 60 Gy). Thus, surgeons are often wary of resection in 
areas that have previously received RT doses of more than 45 to 50 Gy, 
especially in patients who have received definitive doses of preoperative 
concurrent chemoradiation (ie, ≥60 Gy). Soft tissue flap coverage and 
reduced intraoperative fluid administration and ventilator pressures can 
reduce the risk of these complications.441-443 When giving preoperative 
RT to less than definitive doses (eg, 45 Gy), one should be prepared up 
front to continue to a full definitive dose of RT without interruption if the 
patient does not proceed to surgery for some reason. For these reasons, 
when considering trimodality therapy, the treatment plan—including 
assessment for resectability and the type of resection—should be 
decided before initiation of any therapy.  
For patients with advanced lung cancer (ie, stage IV) with extensive 
metastases, systemic therapy is recommended; palliative RT can be 
used for symptom relief and potentially for prophylaxis at primary or 
distant sites (such as pain, bleeding, or obstruction).420,506-508 Shorter 
courses of palliative RT are preferred for patients with symptomatic chest 
disease who have poor PS and/or shorter life expectancy (eg, 17 Gy in 
8.5 Gy fractions), because they provide similar pain relief as longer 
courses, although there is a higher potential need for retreatment (see 
Table 4 in the Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines 
for NSCLC).509-512 Higher dose and longer course thoracic RT (eg, ≥30 
Gy in 10 fractions) are associated with modestly improved survival and 
symptoms, especially in patients with good PS.506,513 When higher doses 
(>30 Gy) are warranted, technologies to reduce normal tissue irradiation 
may be used (at least 3D-CRT and including IMRT or proton therapy as 
appropriate).  
Oligometastatic disease is heterogenous and refers to isolated or limited 
metastatic sites; management is evolving. Definitive local therapy to 
oligometastases (including brain, lung) achieves prolonged survival in a 
small proportion of well-selected patients with good PS who have also 
received radical therapy to the intrathoracic disease.514 Definitive RT to 
oligometastases, particularly SABR, is an appropriate option in such cases 
if it can be delivered safely to the involved sites.515,516 In 2 randomized 
phase II trials, significantly longer PFS was found for local consolidative 
therapy (RT or surgery) to primary and oligometastatic lesions versus 
maintenance systemic therapy or observation for patients not progressing 
on systemic therapy.517,518 Updated data from one of the trials also shows 
that median overall survival was longer for patients with oligometastatic 
NSCLC who received local consolidative therapy (median, 41.2 months; 
95% CI, 18.9 months–not reached) compared with those receiving 
maintenance therapy or observation (median, 17.0 months; 95% CI, 10.1–
39.8 months; P = .017).519 A phase 2 trial of consolidative RT for

oligometastatic NSCLC (n = 29) reported median overall survival of 
28.4 months (95% CI, 14.5–45.8 months).520 The NCCN Guidelines 
recommend that local therapy (RT, SABR, or surgery) to primary and 
oligometastatic lesions should be considered for patients without 
progression on systemic therapy.517-519  
Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy  
SABR (also known as SBRT) uses short courses of very high (ablative), 
highly conformal, and dose-intensive RT precisely delivered to limited-size 
targets.343,521-524 Studies, including prospective multi-institutional trials, 
have demonstrated the efficacy of SABR for patients with inoperable stage 
I NSCLC or for those who refuse surgery.347,525-529 With conventionally 
fractionated RT, 3-year survival is only about 20% to 35% in these 
patients, with local failure rates of about 40% to 60%.344 In prospective 
clinical trials, local control and overall survival appear to be considerably 
increased with SABR, generally more than 85%, and about 60% at 3 years 
(median survival, 4 years), respectively, in patients who are medically 
inoperable.326,344,436,482,484,528,530-535 A 7-year follow-up of 65 patients with 
medically inoperable stage I NSCLC reported that overall survival rates 
were 55.7% at 5 years and 47.5% at 7 years.476 In 12 patients (18.5%), a 
second primary lung carcinoma developed after SABR at a median of 35 
months (range, 5–67 months); 27% (18/65) had disease recurrence a 
median of 14.5 months (range, 4.3–71.5 months) after SABR.  
Substantially higher survival has been observed in patients with 
potentially operable disease who are treated with SABR; survival is 
comparable in population-based comparisons to surgical outcomes, but 
locoregional recurrences are more frequent.484,527,536-541 It has not been 
shown that use of SABR for medically operable patients provides 
long-term outcomes equivalent to surgery. Late recurrences have been 
reported more than 5 years after SABR, highlighting the need for careful 
surveillance.542 If possible, biopsy should confirm NSCLC before use of 
SABR.543,544 A multidisciplinary evaluation is recommended to provide 
consensus that a biopsy is safe or too risky. Data suggest that survival 
outcomes may be biased in patients who do not receive pathologic 
confirmation of malignancy; some of these patients may not have 
NSCLC.543  
SABR is recommended in the NSCLC algorithm for patients with stage I 
and II (T1–3,N0,M0) NSCLC who are medically inoperable; SABR is a 
reasonable alternative to surgery for patients with potentially operable 
disease who are high risk, elderly, or refuse surgery after appropriate 
consultation (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).326,529,531,545,546 A 
combined analysis of 2 randomized trials (that individually did not 
complete accrual) compared SABR to lobectomy.545 This analysis does 
not provide sufficient data to change the standard of care for good 
surgical candidates but helps to confirm the indication for SABR in 
patients with relative contraindications for surgery or those who refuse 
surgery. SABR can also be used for patients with limited lung metastases 
or limited metastases to other body sites.522,529,547-553 After SABR, 
assessment of recurrences by imaging can be challenging because of 
benign inflammatory/fibrotic changes that can remain FDG-PET avid for 2 
or more years after treatment, emphasizing the importance of follow-up by 
a team with experience interpreting such post-treatment effects.554,555 This 
careful follow-up is particularly relevant, because selected patients with 
localized recurrences after SABR may benefit from surgery or re-treatment 
with SABR.556-560  
SABR fractionation regimens and a limited subset of historically used 
maximum dose constraints are provided in the NSCLC algorithm; 1 to 5 
fractions are generally used (see Tables 2 and 3 in the Principles of 
Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).343,526,528,535,561-571 
In the United States, only regimens of 5 fractions or less meet the arbitrary 
billing code definition for SABR; however, slightly more protracted

regimens are also appropriate.571,572 Prescription doses do not completely 
describe the actual delivered doses.573,574 These dose constraints are 
point-of-reference doses and are not intended to be prescriptive; they are 
used commonly or have been used in clinical trials. Although none of 
these dose constraints has been validated as a maximally tolerated dose, 
outcomes of clinical trials to date suggest that they are safe constraints. 
The bronchial tree, esophagus, and brachial plexus are critical structures 
for SABR. For centrally located tumors—those within 2 cm in all directions 
of any mediastinal critical structure, including the bronchial tree, 
esophagus, heart, brachial plexus, major vessels, spinal cord, phrenic 
nerve, and recurrent laryngeal nerve—regimens of 54 to 60 Gy in 3 
fractions are not safe and should be avoided; 4 to 10 fraction SABR 
regimens appear to be effective and safe (see Principles of Radiation 
Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).345,564,575-577 Data from the 
RTOG 0813 trial suggest that 5-fraction regimens are safe.578,579  
SRS or SABR for limited oligometastases to the brain or other body sites, 
respectively, is recommended for patients with good PS if their thoracic 
disease can be treated with definitive therapy (see Stage IV, M1b in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).334,515,516,529,580-583 SRS or SABR can be 
considered for select patients with stage M1c disease who have a limited 
number and volume of metastatic lesions that are amenable to treatment 
with definitive local therapy; limited number is not defined but clinical trials 
have included up to 3 to 5 small metastases.580,581 Targeted therapy and 
consideration of local therapy (eg, surgery or SABR [or SRS] for isolated 
lesions) are recommended for patients with ALK fusions or sensitizing 
EGFR mutations who have progressed on targeted therapy, depending on 
the type of progression.584-587 Decisions about whether to recommend 
SABR should be based on multidisciplinary discussion. Hypofractionated 
or dose-intensified conventional 3D-conformal RT is an option if an 
established SABR program is not available.588-590 Nonrandomized clinical 
data indicate that local tumor control with SABR is higher than with 
interventional radiology ablation techniques. Interventional radiology 
ablation may be appropriate for selected patients for whom local control is 
not necessarily the highest priority.326,347,482  
Whole Brain RT and Stereotactic Radiosurgery 
Many patients with NSCLC have brain metastases (30%–50%), which 
substantially affect their quality of life.20,591 Whole brain RT is associated 
with measurable declines in neurocognitive function in clinical trials, 
particularly with increasing dose and advanced age of the patient.592-594 
However, control of brain metastases confers improved neurocognitive 
function.595,596 For limited metastases, randomized trials have found that 
the addition of whole brain RT to SRS decreases intracranial recurrence 
but does not improve survival and may increase the risk of cognitive 
decline.596,597 Thus, SRS alone is recommended for patients with limited 
volume metastases.598 A randomized trial assessed cognitive function in 
213 patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases who received SRS alone versus 
SRS with whole brain RT; most patients had lung cancer.599 At 3 months 
after SRS alone, patients had less cognitive deterioration (40/63 patients 
[63.5%]) than those receiving SRS plus whole brain RT (44/48 patients 
[91.7%]; difference, -28.2%; 90% CI, -41.9% to -14.4%; P < .001). Some 
have suggested that resection followed by SRS to the cavity (instead of 
resection followed by whole brain RT) will decrease the risk of 
neurocognitive problems.600,601 A study suggests that using IMRT to 
avoid the hippocampus may help decrease memory impairment after 
whole brain RT.602 A phase 3 randomized trial assessed optimal 
supportive care (including dexamethasone) with whole brain RT versus 
optimal supportive care alone in patients with NSCLC and brain 
metastases who were not eligible for brain surgery or SRS.603 Overall 
survival was similar between the groups (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.90–1.26). 
Overall quality of life, use of dexamethasone, and reported adverse 
events were also similar between the arms. Two retrospective analyses

have reported increased survival in patients with brain metastases who 
received SRS and concurrent ICI therapy.604,605  
Options for treatment of limited brain metastases in patients with NSCLC 
include: 1) SRS alone; and 2) surgical resection for selected patients 
followed by SRS or whole brain RT (see the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). Selected patients include those with symptomatic metastases or 
whose tumor tissue is needed for diagnosis.550,591,599,606-612 Decisions about 
whether to recommend SRS alone or brain surgery followed by whole 
brain RT or SRS for limited brain metastases should be based on 
multidisciplinary discussion, weighing the potential benefit over the risk for 
each individual patient.606,613-615 Treatment should be individualized for 
patients with recurrent or progressive brain lesions.616 Treatment of limited 
brain metastases in patients with NSCLC differs from that recommended 
in the NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers, because 
patients with NSCLC and brain metastases often have long-term survival; 
therefore, the potential neurocognitive issues that may occur with whole 
brain RT are a concern.617 Clinicians are using whole brain RT less often 
in patients with NSCLC and limited brain metastases.599 For multiple 
metastases (eg, >3), whole brain RT is recommended; SRS may be 
preferred for patients who have good PS and low systemic tumor burden 
(see the NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers, 
available at www.NCCN.org).598,618-620  
Combined Modality Therapy  
As previously mentioned, surgery provides the best chance for cure for 
patients with stage I or II disease who are medically fit and can tolerate 
surgery. SABR can be considered for patients with unresectable stage I or 
II (T1–3,N0) disease or those who refuse surgery if their disease is node 
negative (see Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy in this Discussion and 
see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). In patients with completely 
resected NSCLC, adjuvant (postoperative) chemotherapy has been shown 
to improve survival in patients with early-stage disease.621-624 Some 
studies suggest that preoperative chemotherapy (also referred to as 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy or induction chemotherapy) is as effective as 
and better tolerated than postoperative chemotherapy (see Preoperative 
Chemotherapy Followed by Surgery: Trial Data in this Discussion).384,625-631 
A randomized trial found no difference in survival with preoperative versus 
postoperative chemotherapy.632 The NCCN Guidelines state that patients 
with stage II or IIIA (T3,N1) disease may be treated with induction 
chemotherapy before surgery if they are candidates for therapy after 
surgery.326,633 Concurrent chemoradiation is more efficacious than 
sequential chemoradiation for patients with unresectable stage III 
disease.634-637 Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents can cause hair loss, 
which is distressing for patients. Hair loss varies depending on the 
regimen and other factors. Data in women with non-metastatic breast 
cancer suggest that a scalp cooling device may help reduce hair loss in 
patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens.638-642  
For patients with stage IV disease who have a good PS, platinum-based 
chemotherapy is beneficial.643-648 Data show that early palliative care 
combined with systemic therapy improved quality of life, mood, and 
survival in patients with metastatic NSCLC, even if these patients had less 
aggressive end-of-life care, when compared with those not receiving 
palliative care alone.649,650 Patients should receive treatment for debilitating 
symptoms.20,651,652 A study also suggests that social support, such as 
being married, is as effective as systemic therapy.653 Data suggest that 
systematic symptom monitoring during outpatient chemotherapy treatment 
increases overall survival when compared with usual care.654-656 Surgery is 
rarely recommended for patients with stage IV disease. However, surgical 
resection of limited brain metastases may improve survival in selected 
patients with stage IV disease and is recommended for selected patients 
in the NCCN Guidelines (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC, available 
at www.NCCN.org).657 Definitive local therapy with surgical resection or

RT is recommended for limited single-organ metastases located in sites 
other than the brain if definitive thoracic therapy is feasible (see Stage 
IVA, M1b in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).334,514,517,519,529,580,581 The 
trials supporting the recommendations for combined modality therapy are 
discussed in the following sections.  
Surgery Followed by Chemotherapy: Trial Data 
The International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial (IALT) assessed 
cisplatin-based postoperative therapy in patients with completely resected 
stage I, II, or III NSCLC.622 The study included 1867 patients with 
surgically resected lung cancer who were randomly assigned either to 
cisplatin-based postoperative chemotherapy or to observation, with a 
median follow-up duration of 56 months. The survival rate at 5 years was 
45% for cisplatin-based therapy versus 40% for observation (HR for death, 
0.86; 95% CI, 0.76–0.98; P < .03); the disease-free survival rate was 39% 
versus 34% at 5 years (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74–0.94; P < .003). However, 
after 7.5 years of follow-up, there were more deaths in the chemotherapy 
group and the benefit of chemotherapy decreased over time.658 Data show 
that postoperative chemotherapy prevents recurrences.  
The NCIC CTG JBR.10 trial and the ANITA trial compared the 
effectiveness of postoperative vinorelbine/cisplatin versus observation in 
early-stage NSCLC. In the JBR.10 trial, 482 patients (ECOG PS of 0–1) 
with completely resected stage IB (T2a,N0) or stage II (T1,N1, or T2,N1) 
NSCLC were randomly assigned either to vinorelbine/cisplatin or to 
observation.623 Postoperative chemotherapy significantly prolonged overall 
survival compared with observation alone (94 vs. 73 months; HR for 
death, 0.69; P = .04) and relapse-free survival (not reached vs. 47 months, 
HR for recurrence, 0.60; P < .001). The 5-year survival rates were 69% 
and 54%, respectively (P = .03). When compared with observation alone, 
postoperative chemotherapy is beneficial for patients with stage II disease 
but not for stage IB disease as shown by updated data from JBR.10 after 
9 years of follow-up.659 In patients with stage II disease receiving 
postoperative chemotherapy, median survival is 6.8 versus 3.6 years in 
those who were only observed. Of note, patients receiving chemotherapy 
did not have an increased death rate.  
In the ANITA trial, 840 patients with stage IB (T2a,N0), II, or IIIA NSCLC 
were randomly assigned either to postoperative vinorelbine/cisplatin or to 
observation.624 Grade 3/4 toxicities were manageable in the chemotherapy 
group; 7 toxic deaths were reported. After a median follow-up of 76 
months, median survival was 66 months in the chemotherapy group and 
44 months in the observation group.624 Postoperative chemotherapy 
significantly improved (8.6%) the 5-year overall survival in patients with 
completely resected stage II and IIIA disease, although no benefit was 
observed in stage I. Some clinicians consider vinorelbine/cisplatin to be 
the preferred regimen for completely resected early-stage NSCLC based 
on the number of trials and the amount of use;660 however, most clinicians 
in the United States prefer to use regimens with less toxicity.661,662  
A meta-analysis of 4,584 patients (LACE) found that postoperative 
cisplatin-based chemotherapy increased survival over 5 years (absolute 
benefit of 5.4%); there was no difference among the chemotherapy 
regimens (vinorelbine, etoposide, and others).663 A subgroup analysis 
found that cisplatin/vinorelbine also increased survival.660 The benefit was 
greater in patients with stage II and III disease and with good PS. 
Postoperative chemotherapy benefited elderly patients up to 80 years of 
age.329,664  
The CALGB 9633 trial assessed paclitaxel/carboplatin in patients with 
stage IB (T2a,N0,M0) lung cancer.665-667 In this trial, 344 patients were 
randomly assigned either to paclitaxel/carboplatin or to observation (within 
4–8 weeks of resection) with a median follow-up duration of 74 months. 
Postoperative chemotherapy was well tolerated with no 
chemotherapy-related toxic deaths. Overall survival at 6 years was not

MS-31 
significantly different (however, a subset analysis showed a benefit for 
tumors 4 cm or more), although 3-year survival was significant (80% vs. 
73%, P = .02).666,667 Thus, the carboplatin/paclitaxel regimen is only 
recommended for early-stage disease if patients cannot tolerate cisplatin 
(see Chemotherapy Regimens for Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Therapy in 
the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).668 It is important to note that the 
CALGB trial was underpowered for patients with stage 1B disease.669  
The TREAT study assessed cisplatin/pemetrexed versus 
cisplatin/vinorelbine as postoperative therapy for patients with completely 
resected stages IB to III NSCLC in a phase 2 randomized trial.661 The trial 
showed that cisplatin/pemetrexed was an effective, less toxic regimen 
compared with cisplatin/vinorelbine; in addition, patients were able to 
receive more cycles of cisplatin/pemetrexed compared with 
cisplatin/vinorelbine.661 Overall survival at 3 years was similar between the 
arms (75% vs. 77%; P = .858).670  
In the NSCLC algorithm for resected stage IA disease, postoperative 
chemotherapy is not recommended based on the trials described in the 
previous paragraphs.671 Postoperative chemotherapy may be considered 
for high-risk, margin-negative, stage IB disease (see the NCCN Guidelines 
for NSCLC). Recommended chemotherapy regimens for preoperative and 
postoperative chemotherapy for patients with patients with completely 
resected stages IB to III NSCLC are provided in the NCCN Guidelines; the 
regimens also include specific dosing (see Chemotherapy Regimens for 
Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).621,671 For the 2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel 
preference stratified all the systemic therapy regimens and decided that 
cisplatin/pemetrexed is the preferred preoperative and postoperative 
regimen for nonsquamous NSCLC.661,670 Cisplatin/gemcitabine and 
cisplatin/docetaxel are the preferred preoperative and postoperative 
regimens for patients with squamous cell NSCLC.672,673 Other 
recommended regimens include cisplatin/vinorelbine and 
cisplatin/etoposide.622-624 Preoperative and postoperative therapy regimens 
for patients with comorbidities or those not able to tolerate cisplatin are 
designated as useful in certain circumstances and include: 1) 
carboplatin/paclitaxel; 2) carboplatin/gemcitabine; and 3) 
carboplatin/pemetrexed (but only for nonsquamous NSCLC).674-677 
Preoperative and postoperative therapy is also known as neoadjuvant and 
adjuvant therapy, respectively.  
Preoperative Chemotherapy Followed by Surgery: Trial Data  
Data from clinical trials in patients with resected NSCLCs indicate that 
delivery of chemotherapy is an important problem. In the postoperative 
setting, significant comorbidities and incomplete recovery after surgery 
often make it difficult for patients to tolerate systemic therapy. This 
problem was demonstrated in NATCH, a phase 3 randomized trial—which 
compared surgery alone to preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy 
with paclitaxel/carboplatin—because 90% of the preoperative cohort 
completed 3 cycles of chemotherapy but only 61% of the postoperative 
cohort completed chemotherapy; however, survival was equivalent among 
all 3 arms.630 A randomized trial found no difference in 3-year overall 
survival (67.4% vs. 67.7%) with preoperative versus postoperative 
chemotherapy in patients with early-stage NSCLC; response rate and 
quality of life were similar in both arms.632 Postoperative chemotherapy 
(with or without RT or reresection) is recommended and typically used for 
early-stage disease in the NCCN Guidelines.326  
Several trials suggest that preoperative therapy is beneficial in patients 
with N2 disease.384,390,629 Other trials suggest that preoperative therapy is 
beneficial in patients with earlier stage disease.626,627,631 A follow-up, 
randomized intergroup trial (SWOG 9900) evaluated preoperative 
paclitaxel/carboplatin in 354 patients with stage IB to IIIA (but not N2) 
disease versus surgery alone. The trial closed prematurely because of

practice changes and was therefore not appropriately powered. This 
SWOG trial did show a trend toward improved PFS (33 vs. 20 months) 
and overall survival (62 vs. 41 months) with preoperative chemotherapy, 
and no difference in resection rates between the 2 arms.631  
Scagliotti et al published a phase 3 trial of preoperative 
cisplatin/gemcitabine versus surgery alone in 270 patients with stage IB to 
IIIA disease. Although the trial closed early, a significant survival benefit 
was seen in patients with stages IIB and IIIA disease who received 
chemotherapy (HR, 0.63).626 Song et al published a meta-analysis of all 
available randomized clinical trials evaluating preoperative chemotherapy 
in resectable NSCLCs. This meta-analysis evaluated 13 randomized trials; 
the HR suggests that overall survival in the preoperative chemotherapy 
arm is longer than the surgery alone arm (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77–0.92; P 
= .0001).625 These results are similar to those reported in another 
meta-analysis (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81–0.98; P = .02).626 The benefit from 
preoperative chemotherapy is similar to that attained with postoperative 
chemotherapy.626,632,663  
Chemoradiation: Trial Data  
The major controversies in NSCLC relate to the management of patients 
with stage IIIA disease (see the Role of Surgery in Patients with Stage IIIA 
(N2) NSCLC in Principles of Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). All 3 treatment modalities—surgical resection, chemotherapy, 
and radiation—may be used when treating stage III disease. The ongoing 
debate centers on which modalities to use and in what sequence.678-682 For 
patients with unresectable stage IIIA or stage IIIB disease, combined 
modality therapy (chemoradiation) is more efficacious than radiation 
alone.678,679,681-683 Concurrent chemoradiation is more efficacious than 
sequential chemoradiation.634-637,684 However, concurrent chemoradiation 
has a higher rate of grade 3 or 4 esophagitis than sequential 
chemoradiation. Selection of patients should be based not only on the 
anticipated response to therapy but also on how well the patient is 
anticipated to tolerate therapy. Accelerated RT regimens may be useful if 
concurrent chemoradiation would not be tolerated.489,685 Sequential 
chemoradiation or RT alone is recommended for frail patients who cannot 
tolerate concurrent chemoradiation.327,686  
JCOG0301, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed chemo/RT using 
low-dose carboplatin versus RT alone in elderly patients (>70 years) with 
unresectable NSCLC.687 Median overall survival was 22.4 months (95% 
CI, 16.5–33.6) for chemoradiotherapy with carboplatin and 16.9 months 
(95% CI, 13.4–20.3) for RT alone (HR, 0.68; 95.4% CI, 0.47–0.98, 
P=.0179). In the chemo/RT group, 3% (3/100) of patients died, whereas 
4% (4/100) of patients died in the RT group. Grade 3 to 4 hematologic 
effects occurred at a greater rate in the chemo/RT arm than in the RT 
alone arm, including leucopenia (61 [63.5%] vs. none), neutropenia (55 
[57.3%] vs. none), and thrombocytopenia (28 [29.2%] vs. 2 [2.0%]). 
Long-term follow-up data show that overall survival is improved in elderly 
patients receiving chemo/RT versus RT alone (HR, 0.743; 95% CI, 0.552–
0.998; P = .0239).688 A study reported that patients with N2 disease and 
an R0 resection had improved survival with postoperative chemotherapy 
followed by postoperative RT (ie, sequential chemoradiation) compared 
with postoperative concurrent chemoradiation (median overall survival, 
58.8 vs. 40.4 months, respectively; P < .001).499 However, there was no 
difference in overall survival when patients with N2 disease and positive 
margins had postoperative sequential chemoradiation compared with 
postoperative concurrent chemoradiation (median overall survival, 42.6 vs. 
38.5 months, respectively; P = .42). Although the optimal sequence is not 
established, postoperative RT is generally administered after adjuvant 
chemotherapy or concurrently for positive resection margins.402,404,405,689  
Concurrent chemoradiation regimens that may be used for all histologies 
for initial treatment include cisplatin/etoposide and carboplatin/paclitaxel

(see Chemotherapy Regimens Used with Radiation Therapy in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).463,634,636,690-695 For nonsquamous NSCLC, 
additional concurrent chemoradiation regimens may be used including 
carboplatin/pemetrexed and cisplatin/pemetrexed.696-698 A weekly 
paclitaxel/carboplatin regimen is another chemoradiation option.463 The 
different options for preoperative, definitive, and postoperative 
chemotherapy/RT are described in detail in the algorithm. For the 2020 
update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel preference stratified all the 
systemic therapy regimens and decided that the following concurrent 
chemoradiation regimens are preferred for patients with NSCLC: 1) 
carboplatin/pemetrexed and cisplatin/pemetrexed for nonsquamous 
NSCLC only; and 2) carboplatin/paclitaxel and cisplatin/etoposide for all 
histologies. For the 2020 update (Version 1), the panel also deleted the 
cisplatin/vinblastine concurrent regimen, because this regimen is rarely 
used in the United States. Recently, the NCCN NSCLC Panel expanded 
the list of regimens for sequential chemoradiation to include regimens 
that are also used for preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy (ie, 
cisplatin combined with pemetrexed [nonsquamous only], docetaxel, 
etoposide, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine; carboplatin combined with 
paclitaxel) and also added 2 new carboplatin regimens for patients with 
comorbidities or those not able to tolerate cisplatin, including 1) 
carboplatin/gemcitabine; and 2) carboplatin/pemetrexed (nonsquamous 
only).  
Durvalumab  
Durvalumab is a human ICI antibody that inhibits PD-L1 (see PD-L1 
Expression Levels and Immunotherapies in this Discussion).309-311,313 
PACIFIC, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared adjuvant treatment with 
durvalumab (also known as consolidation immunotherapy in this setting) 
versus placebo in eligible patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC 
(PS 0–1) who had not progressed after treatment with 2 or more cycles 
of definitive concurrent platinum-based chemoradiation.313,699 Eligible 
patients received adjuvant durvalumab after treatment with concurrent 
chemoradiation (1–42 days). Most patients were current or former 
smokers and did not have EGFR mutations; their PD-L1 status was 
typically less than 25% or unknown. An updated analysis of this trial 
reported that overall survival was increased after durvalumab 
consolidation when compared with placebo (not reached [34.7 months– 
not reached] vs. 28.7 months [22.9– not reached]; stratified HR for death, 
0.68; 99.73% CI, 0.47–0.997; P = .0025).699 The overall survival rate at 
24 months was 66.3% for durvalumab (95% CI, 61.7%–70.4%) versus 
55.6% for placebo (95% CI, 48.9%–61.8%).699 The PFS was 17.2 
months for durvalumab (95% CI, 13.1–23.9) versus 5.6 months for 
placebo (95% CI, 4.6–7.7). Overall survival data after 3 years continue to 
show improvement with durvalumab.700 The median time to death or 
distant metastasis was significantly longer with durvalumab when 
compared with placebo (28.3 months vs. 16.2 months; P < .001). 
Patients receiving durvalumab had a higher ongoing response at 18 
months when compared with placebo (73.5% vs. 52.2%). Durvalumab 
was effective in patients with both squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC. 
Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred at a similar rate in both groups of 
patients (durvalumab, 30.5% vs. placebo, 26.1%). Pneumonia was the 
most common grade 3 or 4 adverse event (durvalumab, 4.4% vs. 
placebo, 3.8%). Durvalumab did not compromise patient-reported 
outcomes.701  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends durvalumab (category 1) as 
consolidation immunotherapy (regardless of PD-L1 status) for eligible 
patients (PS 0–1) with unresectable stage III NSCLC who have not 
progressed after treatment with 2 or more cycles of definitive concurrent 
platinum-based chemoradiation based on this trial and FDA approval.313,699 
It is important to note that adjuvant durvalumab is not recommended for 
patients who have had surgical resection. In addition, durvalumab is used 
as adjuvant treatment in this setting; it is not being used as second-line

therapy. Durvalumab may be used as consolidation immunotherapy after 
treatment with any of the concurrent chemoradiation regimens described 
in the algorithm (eg, cisplatin/etoposide, carboplatin/paclitaxel) (see 
Chemotherapy Regimens Used With Radiation Therapy in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). The panel noted that a few patients with stage II 
NSCLC were included in the PACIFIC trial, which used the older AJCC 
staging (7th edition).  
If patients will be receiving durvalumab but have not received full-dose 
chemotherapy concurrently with RT, the NCCN NSCLC Panel does not 
recommend an additional 2 cycles of full-dose chemotherapy (ie, 
consolidation chemotherapy) based on concerns that adding consolidation 
chemotherapy will increase the risk of pneumonitis if patients are also 
receiving durvalumab. Durvalumab should be discontinued for patients 
with severe or life-threatening pneumonitis and should be withheld or 
discontinued for other severe or life-threatening immune-mediated 
adverse events when indicated (see prescribing information). If patients 
will not be receiving durvalumab because of medical contraindications or 
other reasons, consolidation chemotherapy is an option after concurrent 
chemoradiation if patients have not received full-dose chemotherapy 
concurrently with RT.  
Chemotherapy: Trial Data  
Patients with metastatic (stage IV) NSCLC who have a good PS benefit 
from chemotherapy, usually with a platinum-based regimen, which was 
used for many years before the advent of targeted therapy and 
immunotherapy regimens.645-647 Combination chemotherapy regimens 
produce 1-year survival rates of 30% to 40% and are more efficacious 
than single agents.668,673,702-704 However, survival rates are higher for 
patients with stage IV NSCLC who are eligible for either the newer 
targeted therapy or immunotherapy regimens.10-17 Phase 3 randomized 
trials have shown that many of the platinum-doublet combinations yield 
similar objective response rates and survival.705,706 The platinum-doublet 
regimens differ slightly for toxicity, convenience, and cost; thus, clinicians 
can individualize therapy for their patients.707-710 Carboplatin-based 
regimens include gemcitabine/carboplatin, docetaxel/carboplatin, and 
pemetrexed/carboplatin;673,711-713 non–platinum-based regimens such as 
gemcitabine/vinorelbine and gemcitabine/docetaxel are also options.714-717 
The prognosis for stage IV inoperable lung cancer remains poor if patients 
are not candidates for targeted therapy.  
In the United States, frequently used initial cytotoxic regimens for stage IV 
nonsquamous NSCLC include: 1) cisplatin (or carboplatin)/pemetrexed; or 
2) carboplatin/paclitaxel with (or without) bevacizumab.690,718,719 
Gemcitabine plus cisplatin (or carboplatin) is often used for patients with 
stage IV squamous cell NSCLC.704,709,718,719 These chemotherapy 
regimens are recommended based on phase 3 randomized trials (eg, 
cisplatin/pemetrexed, carboplatin/paclitaxel [with or without bevacizumab], 
gemcitabine/cisplatin) (see Systemic Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic 
Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).704,720 A phase 3 randomized 
trial suggests that conventional cytotoxic agents should not be continued 
beyond 4 to 6 cycles of therapy; however, many patients assigned to a 
longer duration of therapy did not receive the planned number of cycles 
(see Maintenance Therapy in this Discussion).721,722  
A phase 3 randomized trial assessed cisplatin/pemetrexed versus 
cisplatin/gemcitabine as first-line therapy in patients with stage IIIB or IV 
NSCLC.704 For patients with adenocarcinoma who received 
cisplatin/pemetrexed, median overall survival was 12.6 months compared 
with 10.9 months for those receiving cisplatin/gemcitabine (HR, 0.84; 95% 
CI, 0.71–0.99; P = .03). In contrast, for patients with squamous cell 
NSCLC who received cisplatin/pemetrexed, overall survival was 9.4 
versus 10.8 months for those receiving cisplatin/gemcitabine (HR, 1.23; 
95% CI, 1.00–1.51; P = .05). Patients with nonsquamous NSCLC

receiving cisplatin/pemetrexed have less toxicity when compared with 
those receiving cisplatin/gemcitabine.723 Median overall survival was 
similar for both regimens when histologies were combined (8.6 vs. 9.2 
months, respectively; HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.81–1.45; P = .586).  
TAX 326, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed docetaxel plus cisplatin 
(or carboplatin) versus vinorelbine/cisplatin as first-line therapy for patients 
with stage IIIB or IV nonsmall cell lung cancer.673 Docetaxel plus cisplatin 
was associated with similar overall survival (11.3 vs. 10.1 months (P 
=.044; HR, 1.183 [97.2% CI, 0.989–1.416]) and better response rate 
(31.6%) when compared with cisplatin/vinorelbine (24.5%; P =.029); 
docetaxel/cisplatin was associated with better quality of life and was better 
tolerated.  
Many oncologists use pemetrexed-based regimens for stage IV 
adenocarcinomas (if patients are not candidates for targeted therapy or 
PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors), because taxane-based regimens are associated 
with more toxicity (eg, neurotoxicity).704,724 There are no agents for the 
prevention of peripheral neuropathy, and few agents are useful for 
treatment.725 The POINTBREAK trial showed that 
carboplatin/pemetrexed/bevacizumab is a reasonable option for patients 
with metastatic NSCLC and confirmed that taxane-based regimens are 
more toxic than pemetrexed-based regimens.726 The POINTBREAK trial 
also showed that both regimens are similar in regard to overall survival 
rates; therefore, oncologists may return to using taxane-based regimens, 
which are well established. A retrospective cohort study suggests that the 
addition of bevacizumab to carboplatin/paclitaxel does not increase 
survival in older patients (≥65 years) with advanced nonsquamous 
NSCLC.727 However, another retrospective cohort study reported 
increased survival in older patients.728 A combined analysis of the ECOG 
4599 and POINTBREAK trials found a survival benefit with the addition of 
bevacizumab to carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients younger than 75 years 
but no benefit in those older than 75 years.729 
Note that albumin-bound paclitaxel (also known as nab-paclitaxel) can be 
substituted for paclitaxel or docetaxel for patients: 1) who have 
experienced hypersensitivity reactions after receiving paclitaxel or 
docetaxel despite premedication; or 2) in whom premedications (ie, 
dexamethasone, H2 blockers, H1 blockers) to prevent hypersensitivity are 
contraindicated.730,731 A phase 3 randomized trial in patients with 
advanced NSCLC reported that an albumin-bound paclitaxel/carboplatin 
regimen is associated with less neurotoxicity and improved response rate, 
when compared with the control arm of paclitaxel/carboplatin.732 Based on 
the trial and the FDA approval, the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends an 
albumin-bound paclitaxel/carboplatin regimen as initial cytotoxic therapy 
for patients with advanced NSCLC and good PS.  
Chemotherapy is recommended for patients with stage IV NSCLC and 
negative test results for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, METex14 skipping, or BRAF 
genetic variants; PD-L1 expression less than 1%; and contraindications to 
PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors. Recommended chemotherapy regimens are 
based on PS and include platinum agents (eg, cisplatin, carboplatin), 
taxanes (eg, paclitaxel, albumin-bound paclitaxel [also known as 
nab-paclitaxel], docetaxel), vinorelbine, etoposide, pemetrexed, and 
gemcitabine (see Systemic Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Disease in 
the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). To clarify use of systemic therapy, the 
NCCN Guidelines list all of the combination systemic therapy regimens 
and single agents that are recommended for patients with metastatic 
NSCLC depending on histology and PS (see Systemic Therapy for 
Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).  
For patients with advanced NSCLC who have a PS of 2, platinum-based 
combinations and a few single-agent chemotherapy agents are 
recommended in the NCCN Guidelines; cisplatin-based regimens are not

recommended in this setting.204 For nonsquamous NSCLC or NSCLC 
NOS, single-agent chemotherapy includes gemcitabine, pemetrexed, or 
taxanes; combination chemotherapy regimens include 
carboplatin/paclitaxel or carboplatin/pemetrexed.733-735 Patients with a PS 
of 2 are often just treated with single-agent chemotherapy because of 
concerns about toxicity.736 Treatment with carboplatin/pemetrexed 
increased median overall survival when compared with pemetrexed alone 
(9.3 vs. 5.3 months, P = .001) in patients with a PS of 2; however, 4 
treatment-related deaths occurred in the carboplatin/pemetrexed 
arm.733,737 
For the 2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel preference 
stratified all the systemic therapy regimens. The newer 
chemotherapy/pembrolizumab regimens are preferred for eligible patients 
with metastatic NSCLC who do not have contraindications to 
immunotherapy and are not candidates for targeted therapy (see Systemic 
Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC and Pembrolizumab in this Discussion). For patients with 
metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC and PS 0 to 1 who have 
contraindications to immunotherapy, the panel decided that the following 
chemotherapy regimens are “useful in certain circumstances,” including 
1) carboplatin with paclitaxel (or albumin-bound paclitaxel), docetaxel, 
etoposide, gemcitabine, or pemetrexed; all are category 1; 2) cisplatin 
with paclitaxel (or albumin-bound paclitaxel), docetaxel, etoposide, 
gemcitabine, or pemetrexed; all are category 1; 3) bevacizumab with 
carboplatin and either paclitaxel or pemetrexed; and 4) gemcitabine with 
either docetaxel or vinorelbine. The panel also preference stratified the 
regimens for patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC and PS 2; 
carboplatin/pemetrexed is preferred for patients with adenocarcinoma. 
The regimens for patients with metastatic squamous cell NSCLC have 
also been preference stratified.  
The initial cytotoxic systemic therapy regimens were recently revised by 
deleting options that are less effective, more toxic, and/or infrequently 
used in the United States based on each panel member’s experience and 
data generated by surveying the NCCN NSCLC Panel (see the NCCN 
Guidelines with Evidence Blocks™ for NSCLC, available at 
www.NCCN.org). For patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC and 
NSCLC NOS, panel members deleted carboplatin/vinorelbine, 
cisplatin/vinorelbine, etoposide, irinotecan, and vinorelbine. For patients 
with metastatic squamous cell NSCLC, panel members deleted 
carboplatin/etoposide, carboplatin/vinorelbine, 
cisplatin/gemcitabine/necitumumab, cisplatin/vinorelbine, etoposide, 
irinotecan, and vinorelbine.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel voted unanimously to delete the 
necitumumab/cisplatin/gemcitabine regimen from the NCCN Guidelines for 
patients with metastatic squamous cell NSCLC. This decision reflects the 
fact that the NCCN NSCLC Panel feels the addition of necitumumab to the 
regimen is not beneficial based on toxicity, cost, and limited improvement 
in efficacy when compared with cisplatin/gemcitabine. A phase 3 
randomized trial only showed a slight improvement in overall survival (11.5 
months; 95% CI, 10.4–12.6; vs. 9.9 months; 95% CI, 8.9–11.1).738 The 
stratified HR was only 0.84 (95% CI, 0.74–0.96; P = .01). In addition, there 
were more grade 3 or higher adverse events in patients receiving the 
necitumumab regimen (388 [72%] of 538 patients) than in patients 
receiving only the gemcitabine/cisplatin (333 [62%] of 541). Although it has 
been suggested that adding necitumumab to cisplatin/gemcitabine adds 
value and is cost-effective, the NCCN NSCLC Panel does not agree.739  
Targeted Therapies  
Specific targeted therapies are available for the treatment of eligible 
patients with metastatic NSCLC.158,740,741 Afatinib, alectinib, brigatinib,

trametinib, entrectinib, larotrectinib, and lorlatinib are oral TKIs. 
Bevacizumab and ramucirumab are recombinant monoclonal antibodies 
that target the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or VEGF 
receptor, respectively. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets 
EGFR. Erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and dacomitinib inhibit EGFR 
sensitizing mutations; osimertinib inhibits both EGFR sensitizing mutations 
and T790M. Crizotinib inhibits ALK fusions, ROS1 fusions, and MET 
tyrosine kinases (ie, high-level MET amplification, METex14 skipping 
mutation). Ceritinib inhibits ALK fusions and IGF-1 receptor. Alectinib 
inhibits ALK and RET fusions.742 Brigatinib inhibits various ALK fusions 
and other targets.743 Lorlatinib inhibits ALK and ROS1 fusions.275,277,744,745 
Dabrafenib inhibits BRAF V600E mutations; trametinib inhibits MEK; both 
agents inhibit different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway.168,169 
Entrectinib and larotrectinib inhibit TRK fusion proteins.284,286,287 
Capmatinib inhibits several MET tyrosine kinases including METex14 
skipping mutations.294 Selpercatinib, pralsetinib, cabozantinib, and 
vandetanib inhibit RET rearrangements.152,303,304,746 Other targeted 
therapies are being developed (see Emerging Biomarkers to Identify Novel 
Therapies for Patients with Metastatic NSCLC in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). Flare phenomenon may occur in some patients who discontinue 
targeted therapies for EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 genetic variants. If disease 
flare occurs, then the targeted therapies should be restarted.747-750  
It is important to note that targeted therapies are recommended for 
patients with metastatic NSCLC and specific oncogenic drivers, 
independent of PD-L1 levels. Patients with metastatic NSCLC and PD-L1 
expression levels of 1% or more—but who also have a targetable driver 
oncogene molecular variant (eg, EGFR, ALK, ROS1)—should receive 
first-line targeted therapy for that oncogene and not first-line ICIs, because 
targeted therapies yield higher response rates (eg, osimertinib, 80%) than 
ICIs (poor response rates) in the first-line setting, targeted therapy is better 
tolerated, and these patients are unlikely to respond to ICIs.249,321-323,751 For 
the 2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel emphasizes that 
clinicians should obtain molecular testing results for actionable biomarkers 
before administering first-line therapy, if clinically feasible. Therefore, the 
panel deleted “or unknown” regarding test results for actionable molecular 
biomarkers before administering PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors. At a minimum, 
EGFR and ALK status should be known before starting first-line systemic 
therapy, if clinically feasible; however, it is ideal if ROS1 and BRAF status 
are also known. If it is not feasible to do molecular testing, then patients 
are treated as though they do not have driver oncogenes.  
VEGF or VEGF Receptor Inhibitors  
Bevacizumab 
Bevacizumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF. 
ECOG 4599, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed bevacizumab added to 
paclitaxel/carboplatin versus chemotherapy alone in patients with 
recurrent or advanced nonsquamous NSCLC (stage IIIB–IV).720 In the 
bevacizumab/chemotherapy group, median survival was 12.3 months 
versus 10.3 months with chemotherapy alone (HR for death, 0.79; 
P=0.003). Clinically significant bleeding occurred more often with 
bevacizumab/chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone (4.4% vs. 0.7%, 
respectively; P < .001). Fifteen treatment-related deaths were reported 
with bevacizumab/chemotherapy. 
Bevacizumab may be added to carboplatin/paclitaxel (category 1), 
carboplatin/pemetrexed, or cisplatin/pemetrexed. For the 2020 update 
(Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel preference stratified the systemic 
therapy regimens and decided that these specific bevacizumab plus 
chemotherapy first-line therapy options are “useful in certain 
circumstances” for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based on 
clinical data and the FDA approval.720,752 These bevacizumab plus 
chemotherapy regimens are an option for patients with PS 0 to 1, 
nonsquamous NSCLC or NSCLC NOS, negative test results for EGFR,

ALK, ROS1, METex14 skipping, or BRAF variants, PD-L1 expression less 
than 1%, and contraindications to PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors (see 
Sensitizing EGFR Mutation Positive/First-Line Therapy or ALK 
Positive/First-Line Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).  
Bevacizumab in combination with a PD-L1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy 
(eg, ABCP) is a first-line therapy option (category 1, other recommended) 
regardless of PD-L1 expression for patients with PS 0 to 1; nonsquamous 
NSCLC or NSCLC NOS; negative test results for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, 
METex14 skipping, or BRAF variants; and no contraindications to PD-1 or 
PD-L1 inhibitors or bevacizumab (see Atezolizumab in this Discussion). 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends that bevacizumab biosimilars may 
be used in any of the systemic therapy regimens containing bevacizumab 
(eg, carboplatin plus paclitaxel plus bevacizumab) that are used for eligible 
patients with metastatic NSCLC based on clinical data and FDA 
approvals.753-757 To receive treatment with bevacizumab and 
chemotherapy, patients must meet the following criteria: nonsquamous 
NSCLC and no recent history of hemoptysis. Any regimen with a high risk 
for thrombocytopenia—and, therefore, possible bleeding—should be used 
with caution when combined with bevacizumab. Bevacizumab is not 
recommended for patients with squamous cell NSCLC.  
Ramucirumab  
Ramucirumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF 
receptors. 
First-Line Therapy 
RELAY, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared first-line therapy with 
ramucirumab/erlotinib versus erlotinib alone in patients with advanced 
NSCLC and sensitizing EGFR mutations.758 PFS was 19.4 months (95% 
CI, 15.4–21.6) with ramucirumab/erlotinib versus 12.4 months (95% CI,  
11.0–13.5) with erlotinib alone (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.46–0.76; P < .0001). 
Serious adverse events (grade 3–4) occurred in 72% (159/221) of patients 
receiving erlotinib/ramucirumab (including hypertension) versus 54% 
(121/225) in those receiving erlotinib alone (including increased alanine 
aminotransferase [ALT]). One treatment-related death occurred in a 
patient receiving erlotinib/ramucirumab. For the 2020 update (Version 2), 
the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends erlotinib/ramucirumab as a 
first-line therapy option for patients with EGFR-positive metastatic 
NSCLC (category 2A, other recommended intervention) based on clinical 
data.758  
Subsequent Therapy 
REVEL, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed ramucirumab/docetaxel 
versus docetaxel alone in patients with metastatic NSCLC that had 
progressed.759 The median overall survival was 10.5 months for 
ramucirumab/docetaxel versus 9.1 months for docetaxel alone (HR, 0.86; 
95% CI, 0.75–0.98; P < .023). More than 70% of patients had grade 3 or 
higher adverse events in both groups (79% for ramucirumab/docetaxel vs. 
71% for docetaxel alone). Adverse events of special concern with 
ramucirumab/docetaxel therapy include risk for severe hemorrhage, grade 
3 to 4 gastrointestinal bleeding, gastrointestinal perforation or fistula, 
impaired wound healing, and poorly controlled hypertension. There were 
16 deaths from grade 3 or worse pulmonary hemorrhage and other 
adverse events in the REVEL trial: 8 deaths in the ramucirumab/docetaxel 
arm and 8 deaths in the docetaxel alone arm. The NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends ramucirumab/docetaxel (category 2A) as a subsequent 
therapy option for patients with metastatic NSCLC, regardless of histology, 
that has progressed after first-line chemotherapy based on the REVEL trial 
and the FDA approval.759,760

Oral TKIs that Inhibit EGFR Mutations 
Osimertinib 
Osimertinib (AZD9291) is an oral TKI that inhibits both EGFR sensitizing 
mutations and T790M. As previously mentioned, EGFR sensitizing 
mutations include Exon19del and L858R as well as other rarer mutations 
(see EGFR Mutations in this Discussion). Both mutations are associated 
with sensitivity to the small-molecule oral EGFR TKIs, such as osimertinib, 
erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and dacomitinib.200 The NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends EGFR mutation testing (category 1) in certain patients with 
metastatic NSCLC based on data showing the efficacy of several agents 
for patients with EGFR mutations and on the FDA approvals (see 
Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines 
for NSCLC).321,761 EGFR T790M is a mutation associated with acquired 
resistance to first-line therapy with EGFR TKIs and has been reported in 
about 60% of patients with disease progression after initial response to 
sensitizing EGFR TKIs.197,218-224 Most patients with sensitizing EGFR 
mutations and metastatic NSCLC typically progress after about 9.7 to 13 
months of therapy with erlotinib, gefitinib, or afatinib.207,212,219,226 Data show 
that patients receiving osimertinib as first-line therapy have PFS of about 
19 months.321,762 Flare phenomenon may occur in some patients who 
discontinue EGFR TKIs. If disease flare occurs, then the EGFR TKIs

FLAURA, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed first-line therapy with 
osimertinib compared with either erlotinib or gefitinib in patients with 
metastatic NSCLC and EGFR mutations regardless of T790M 
status.10,321,761,762 PFS was longer with osimertinib (18.9 months; 95% CI, 
15.2–21.4) compared with either erlotinib or gefitinib (10.2 months; 95% 
CI, 9.6–11.1; HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.37–0.57; P < .001]). The median 
duration of response was longer with osimertinib compared with erlotinib 
or gefitinib (median response, 17.2 vs. 8.5 months). Only 6% (17/279) of 
patients receiving osimertinib had CNS progression events when 
compared with 15% (42/277) of those receiving erlotinib or gefitinib. Grade 
3 or higher adverse events were reported in 34% (94/279) of patients 
receiving osimertinib and 45% (124/277) of patients receiving erlotinib or 
gefitinib. An updated analysis showed that median overall survival was 
38.6 months with osimertinib (95% CI, 34.5–41.8) compared with 31.8 
months (95% CI, 26.6–36.0) for either erlotinib or gefitinib (HR, 0.8; 95% 
CI, 0.64–1.0; P = .046).10  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends osimertinib as a preferred first-line 
therapy option for patients with metastatic NSCLC who have sensitizing 
EGFR mutations based on the phase 3 trial and FDA approval.10,321 
Osimertinib is a category 1 (preferred) recommended option if an EGFR 
mutation is discovered before giving first-line systemic therapy (eg, 
pembrolizumab/chemotherapy), and osimertinib is a category 2A 
(preferred) option if an EGFR mutation is discovered during first-line 
systemic therapy.10 For patients receiving first-line ICIs with or without 
chemotherapy, oncologists should be aware of the long half-life of the ICIs 
and potential adverse effects when combining ICIs with osimertinib.763-765  
Subsequent Therapy 
AURA3, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed osimertinib versus 
platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy in patients with EGFR 
T790M-positive metastatic NSCLC who had progressed on first-line 
erlotinib, gefitinib, or afatinib. PFS was longer with osimertinib compared 
with chemotherapy (10.1 vs. 4.4 months; HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.23–0.41; P 
< .001).226 PFS was also longer in patients with CNS metastases who 
received osimertinib versus chemotherapy (8.5 vs. 4.2 months; HR, 0.32; 
95% CI, 0.21–0.49). In addition, the objective response rate was increased 
with osimertinib (71%; 95% CI, 65%–76%) compared with chemotherapy

(31%; 95% CI, 24%–40%) (odds ratio for objective response, 5.39; 95% 
CI, 3.47–8.48; P < .001). The disease control rate was about 93% with 
osimertinib (95% CI, 90%–96%) and about 74% with chemotherapy (95% 
CI, 66%–81%). Patients receiving osimertinib had fewer grade 3 or higher 
adverse events compared with those receiving chemotherapy (23% vs. 
47% [63/279 vs. 64/136]). There were 4 fatal events with osimertinib 
(respiratory failure [2 patients], pneumonitis, and ischemic stroke) and one 
with chemotherapy (hypovolemic shock).  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends osimertinib (category 1) as a 
subsequent therapy option for patients with metastatic EGFR 
T790M-positive NSCLC who have progressed on EGFR TKIs (including 
erlotinib with or without ramucirumab or bevacizumab) based on the phase 
3 randomized trial and FDA approval [see Second-Line and Beyond 
(Subsequent) Systemic Therapy in this Discussion].226 For patients with 
sensitizing EGFR mutations who progress during or after first-line therapy 
with osimertinib, recommended subsequent therapy depends on whether 
the progression is asymptomatic or symptomatic and includes: 1) 
considering local therapy (eg, SABR or surgery); 2) continuing osimertinib; 
or 3) a first-line systemic therapy regimen for metastatic NSCLC (such as 
carboplatin/paclitaxel). There are no data to support using erlotinib (with or 
without ramucirumab or bevacizumab), gefitinib, afatinib, or dacomitinib 
after progression on first-line therapy with osimertinib. T790M can be 
assessed using an FDA-approved test or other validated laboratory test 
done in a CLIA-approved laboratory. Data suggest that plasma genotyping 
(also known as plasma testing or liquid biopsy) may be considered at 
progression instead of tissue biopsy to detect whether patients have 
T790M; however, if plasma testing is negative, then tissue biopsy is 
recommended.766-768 The NCCN NSCLC Panel also recommends 
osimertinib (category 1) for patients with T790M who have symptomatic 
brain metastases after progression on erlotinib (with or without 
ramucirumab or bevacizumab), gefitinib, afatinib, or dacomitinib based on 
data showing an improvement.226,769-772  
Updated data from the BLOOM study suggest that osimertinib is beneficial 
for patients with EGFR mutations (regardless of T790M status) who have 
progressive leptomeningeal disease.773 In the BLOOM study (n = 32), 23 
patients receiving osimertinib (160 mg once daily) had brain imaging 
assessment; 10 had radiologic improvement and 13 had stable disease. At 
a 12-week neurologic assessment, 88% (7/8) of symptomatic patients had 
improved and one had stable disease. Of 15 asymptomatic patients, 87% 
(13/15) remained asymptomatic.773 Several studies suggested that pulse 
erlotinib is beneficial for patients with EGFR mutations who have 
progressive leptomeningeal disease.774-776 In one study of high-dose 
erlotinib, neurologic symptoms and PS improved in 50% (6/12) and 33% 
(4/12) of patients, respectively; median survival was 6.2 months (95% CI, 
2.5–8.5).776 Based on these studies, the NCCN NSCLC Panel feels that 
osimertinib (regardless of T790M status) can be considered for patients 
with EGFR mutations who have progressive leptomeningeal disease. For 
the 2020 update (Version 1), pulse erlotinib was deleted as an option for 
progressive leptomeningeal disease because osimertinib is a better option 
in this setting.  
Erlotinib and Gefitinib 
Erlotinib and gefitinib are oral TKIs that inhibit sensitizing EGFR mutations. 
IPASS, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed first-line therapy with 
gefitinib alone versus carboplatin/paclitaxel in Asian patients with 
EGFR-positive metastatic NSCLC.212 Patients with sensitizing EGFR 
mutations who received gefitinib had longer PFS (24.9% vs. 6.7%), 
increased response rate (71.2% vs. 47.3%), and improved quality of life 
with fewer side effects (eg, neutropenia) compared with 
carboplatin/paclitaxel.212 Updated results from the IPASS trial showed that 
overall survival was similar in patients receiving gefitinib or chemotherapy

MS-41 
regardless of sensitizing EGFR mutation status.777 These results probably 
occurred because patients who had been assigned to first-line 
chemotherapy were able to receive TKIs as subsequent therapy if they 
were found to have sensitizing EGFR mutations.  
EURTAC, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed first-line therapy with 
erlotinib versus chemotherapy in European patients with metastatic 
NSCLC and sensitizing EGFR mutations.207 PFS was longer and response 
rate was increased for those receiving erlotinib compared with 
chemotherapy.207 For erlotinib, the median PFS was 9.7 months (95% CI, 
8.4–12.3) compared with 5.2 months (95% CI, 4.5–5.8) for chemotherapy 
(HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25–0.54; P < .0001). Fewer patients receiving 
erlotinib had severe adverse events or died when compared with those 
receiving chemotherapy. The FDA has approved the use of erlotinib as 
first-line therapy in patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations.778 
Previously, erlotinib was commonly used in the United States in patients 
with sensitizing EGFR mutations because of restrictions on the use of 
gefitinib. However, gefitinib was re-approved by the FDA based on a 
phase 4 study and is available in the United States.157,779  
CALGB 30406, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared first-line erlotinib 
monotherapy versus erlotinib plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel in patients 
(mainly Caucasian) with advanced NSCLC and sensitizing EGFR 
mutations.780 Erlotinib monotherapy was associated with fewer side effects 
in patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations compared with 
erlotinib/chemotherapy. Thus, it is appropriate to interrupt or complete 
planned chemotherapy and switch to EGFR TKI therapy in patients found 
to have sensitizing EGFR mutations during first-line chemotherapy (see 
EGFR Mutation Positive/First-Line Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).781 The NCCN Guidelines do not recommend adding EGFR TKIs 
to current chemotherapy based on this CALGB study.780 EGFR TKIs may 
be continued in patients who have progressed if patients do not have 
multiple systemic symptomatic lesions (see Continuation of Targeted 
Therapy After Progression on Initial Therapy in this Discussion).  
WJOG 5108L, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed gefitinib versus 
erlotinib for patients with advanced lung cancer who had been previously 
treated with chemotherapy; most patients (72%) were positive for EGFR 
mutations.782 The median PFS was 8.3 months for gefitinib versus 10.0 
months for erlotinib in patients positive for EGFR mutations (HR, 1.093; 
95% CI, 0.879–1.358; P = .424). The main grade 3 or 4 toxicities 
included rash (gefitinib: 2.2% vs. erlotinib: 18.1%) and increases in 
ALT/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (gefitinib: 6.1%/13.0% vs. 
erlotinib: 2.2%/3.3%).  
An analysis of 5 clinical trials in patients, mainly from the Western 
hemisphere, (n = 223) with advanced NSCLC (stage IIIB or IV) found that 
those with sensitizing EGFR mutations who received TKIs had a 67% 
response rate and an overall survival of about 24 months.783 The TORCH 
trial suggested that EGFR mutation testing should be done in patients with 
advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.784 Survival was longer in patients with 
wild-type EGFR who received first-line chemotherapy compared with 
those who received erlotinib first followed by subsequent chemotherapy 
(11.6 vs. 8.7 months). The OPTIMAL trial reported that PFS was 
increased in patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations who received 
erlotinib.210,211 EGFR TKIs are recommended in patients with metastatic 
NSCLC and sensitizing EGFR mutations, because quality of life is 
improved when compared with chemotherapy. Erlotinib and gefitinib are 
orally active TKIs that are very well tolerated by most patients.785,786  
RELAY, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared first-line therapy with 
erlotinib/ramucirumab versus erlotinib alone in patients with advanced 
NSCLC and sensitizing EGFR mutations.758 PFS was 19.4 months (95% 
CI, 15.4–21.6) with erlotinib/ramucirumab versus 12.4 months (95% CI, 
11.0–13.5) with erlotinib (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.46–0.76; P < .0001). The

overall response rate was similar (erlotinib/ramucirumab: 76% versus 
erlotinib alone: 75%). Serious adverse events (grade 3–4) occurred in 
72% (159/221) of patients receiving erlotinib/ramucirumab (including 
hypertension) versus 54% (121/225) in those receiving erlotinib alone 
(including increased ALT). One treatment-related death occurred in a 
patient receiving erlotinib/ramucirumab.  
NEJ026, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared first-line erlotinib plus 
bevacizumab versus erlotinib alone in patients with EGFR-positive 
advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.787 At interim analysis, PFS was 16.9 
months (95% CI, 14.2–21.0) for erlotinib/bevacizumab versus 13.3 months 
(95% CI, 11.1–15.3) for erlotinib alone (HR, 0.605; 95% CI, 0.417–0.877; 
P = .016). Grade 4 adverse events occurred in 8% (9/112) of patients 
receiving erlotinib/bevacizumab (including neutropenia, hepatic 
dysfunction) versus 4% (5/114) of patients receiving erlotinib alone 
(hepatic dysfunction); no treatment-related deaths were reported.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends erlotinib and gefitinib as first-line 
therapy options in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC who 
have known active sensitizing EGFR mutations (regardless of their PS) 
based on these trials and FDA approvals (see Sensitizing EGFR Mutation 
Positive in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).105,212,788,789 Erlotinib and 
gefitinib are category 1 (other recommended) options if an EGFR mutation 
is discovered before giving first-line systemic therapy (eg, 
pembrolizumab/chemotherapy), and they are category 2A options if an 
EGFR mutation is discovered during first-line systemic therapy. For the 
2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel preference stratified 
the systemic therapy regimens and decided that erlotinib and gefitinib 
are “other recommended” options for patients with EGFR 
mutation--positive metastatic NSCLC; osimertinib is the preferred option 
in this setting. The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends EGFR mutation 
testing (category 1) in certain patients with metastatic NSCLC based on 
data showing the efficacy of several agents for patients with EGFR 
mutations and on the FDA approvals (see Principles of Molecular and 
Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).207,212 For the 
2020 update (Version 2), the NCCN NSCLC Panel added 
erlotinib/ramucirumab as a first-line therapy option for patients with 
EGFR positive metastatic NSCLC (category 2A, other recommended 
intervention) based on clinical data.758 The panel also added 
erlotinib/bevacizumab as a first-line therapy option for patients with 
EGFR positive metastatic NSCLC (category 2B, useful in certain 
circumstances) based on clinical data.787  
Afatinib  
Afatinib is a second-generation oral TKI that irreversibly inhibits the 
ErbB/HER family of receptors including EGFR and ERBB2.790,791 
LUX-Lung 3, a phase 3 randomized trial, reported that first-line therapy 
with afatinib improved PFS when compared with cisplatin/pemetrexed in 
patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma who have sensitizing EGFR 
mutations (11.1 vs. 6.9 months, P = .001).206 The NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends afatinib as a first-line therapy option in patients with 
metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC who have sensitizing EGFR mutations 
based on the clinical trial and FDA approval (see the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).206,790,792-794 Afatinib is a category 1 (other recommended) option if 
an EGFR mutation is discovered before giving first-line systemic therapy 
(eg, pembrolizumab/chemotherapy). Afatinib is a category 2A option if an 
EGFR mutation is discovered during first-line systemic therapy. For the 
2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel preference stratified 
the systemic therapy regimens and decided that afatinib is an “other 
recommended” option; osimertinib is the preferred option in this setting. 
Afatinib may also be continued in patients who have progressed if patients 
do not have multiple systemic symptomatic lesions (see Continuation of 
Targeted Therapy After Progression on Initial Therapy in this 
Discussion).200 However, afatinib is not recommended as subsequent

therapy based on a phase 3 randomized trial showing low response rates; 
it is less efficacious and safe compared to other available options [see 
Second-Line and Beyond (Subsequent) Systemic Therapy in this 
Discussion].795  
A phase 2B trial assessed afatinib compared with gefitinib for first-line 
therapy in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma and sensitizing EGFR 
mutations.796 The PFS was essentially the same in patients receiving 
afatinib when compared with those receiving gefitinib (median PFS, 11.0 
months [95% CI, 10.6–12.9] with afatinib vs. 10.9 months [9.1–11.5] with 
gefitinib; HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57–0.95; P = .017). These slight PFS 
differences are not clinically relevant. Updated results indicate that overall 
survival was not significantly different between afatinib and gefitinib (27.9 
vs. 24.5 months [HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.66‒1.12; P = .2580]).797 Patients 
receiving afatinib had more serious treatment-related side effects when 
compared with those receiving gefitinib (11% [17/160] for afatinib vs. 4% 
[7/159] for gefitinib). One patient receiving gefitinib died from 
treatment-related hepatic and renal failure; other deaths were not 
considered to be related to treatment (9% vs. 6% [15/160 vs. 10/159]). 
More patients receiving afatinib had diarrhea (13% vs. 1%), whereas more 
patients receiving gefitinib had elevations in liver enzyme levels (0% vs. 
9%). The NCCN Guidelines do not state that afatinib is more efficacious 
than gefitinib (see the NCCN Guidelines with Evidence Blocks™ for 
NSCLC, available at www.NCCN.org).782 Afatinib is rated as slightly less 
safe than erlotinib or gefitinib (ie, a rating of 3 for afatinib vs. 4 for erlotinib 
and gefitinib) (see the NCCN Guidelines with Evidence Blocks™ for 
NSCLC, available at www.NCCN.org). 
Dacomitinib 
Like afatinib, dacomitinib is a second-generation oral TKI that irreversibly 
inhibits ErbB/HER receptors including EGFR, HER1, HER2, and HER4. 
ARCHER 1050, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared dacomitinib versus 
gefitinib as first-line therapy for patients with sensitizing EGFR-positive 
metastatic NSCLC.798,799 Patients with brain metastases were not eligible 
for enrollment. PFS was increased in patients receiving dacomitinib (14.7 
months; 95% CI, 11.1–16.6) compared with those receiving gefitinib (9.2 
months; 95% CI, 9.1–11.0). Serious adverse events related to treatment 
were reported in 21 (9%) patients given dacomitinib and in 10 (4%) 
patients given gefitinib. Treatment-related deaths included 2 patients in the 
dacomitinib group (one related to untreated diarrhea and one to untreated 
cholelithiasis/liver disease) and one patient in the gefitinib group (related 
to sigmoid colon diverticulitis/rupture complicated by pneumonia). An 
updated analysis reported that the median overall survival was 34.1 
months (95% CI, 29.5–37.7) in patients receiving dacomitinib compared 
with 26.8 months (95% CI, 23.7–32.1) in those receiving gefitinib (HR, 
0.760; 95% CI, 0.582–0.993; two-sided P = .044).798  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends dacomitinib as a first-line 
treatment option for patients with sensitizing EGFR-positive metastatic 
NSCLC based on these clinical trial data and the FDA approval.770,798 
Dacomitinib is a category 1 (other recommended) option if an EGFR 
mutation is discovered before giving first-line systemic therapy (eg, 
pembrolizumab/chemotherapy); dacomitinib is a category 2A option if an 
EGFR mutation is discovered during first-line systemic therapy. For the 
2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel preference stratified 
the systemic therapy regimens and decided that dacomitinib is an “other 
recommended” option; osimertinib is the preferred option in this setting.  
Oral TKIs that Inhibit ALK and ROS1 Fusions 
Alectinib 
Alectinib is an oral TKI that inhibits ALK and RET rearrangements (also 
known as fusions) but not ROS1 fusions.742

First-Line Therapy 
ALEX, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed first-line therapy with 
alectinib versus crizotinib in 303 patients with ALK-positive advanced 
NSCLC including those with asymptomatic CNS disease.251 Disease 
progression or death occurred in fewer patients receiving alectinib (41% 
[62/152]; median follow-up of 18.6 months) when compared with crizotinib 
(68% [102/151]; median follow-up of 17.6 months). The HR was 0.47 (95% 
CI, 0.34–0.65; P < .001) for disease progression or death. PFS was 
significantly increased with alectinib (68.4%; 95% CI, 61.0%–75.9%) 
versus crizotinib (48.7%; 95% CI, 40.4%–56.9%). The median PFS was 
not reached for alectinib (95% CI, 17.7–not reached) when compared with 
crizotinib at 11.1 months (95% CI, 9.1–13.1). Fewer patients receiving 
alectinib had CNS progression (12% [18/152]) versus crizotinib (45% 
[68/151]). Response rates were 83% (126/152) in the alectinib group 
versus 75% (114/151) in the crizotinib group (P = .09). Patients receiving 
alectinib had fewer grade 3 to 5 adverse events when compared with 
crizotinib (41% [63/152] vs. 50% [75/151], respectively) even though 
patients received alectinib for a longer duration than crizotinib (median, 
17.9 vs. 10.7 months). Fewer deaths were reported with alectinib (3.3% 
[5/152]) versus crizotinib (4.6% [7/151]); 2 treatment-related deaths were 
reported in the crizotinib arm and none in the alectinib arm.  
J-ALEX, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed first-line therapy with 
alectinib versus crizotinib in 207 Japanese patients with ALK-positive 
advanced NSCLC.800 Median PFS was not reached with alectinib (95% CI, 
20.3 months–not reached) versus 10.2 months (95% CI, 8.2–12.0) with 
crizotinib (HR, 0.34; 99.7% CI, 0.17–0.71; stratified log-rank P < .0001). 
Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were less frequent with alectinib (26% 
[27/103]) when compared with crizotinib (52% [54/104]); adverse events 
did not lead to death in either group. Fewer patients stopped taking 
alectinib (9%) because of an adverse event when compared with crizotinib 
(20%).  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends alectinib as a first-line therapy 
option for patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC based on clinical 
trial data and the FDA approval.251,800,801 Panel members voted that 
alectinib is the preferred first-line therapy option for patients with 
metastatic NSCLC who are positive for ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC 
based on these trials. Alectinib is a category 1 (preferred) option if an ALK 
rearrangement is discovered before giving first-line systemic therapy (eg, 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy); alectinib is a category 2A (preferred) 
option if an ALK rearrangement is discovered during first-line systemic 
therapy. Brigatinib, ceritinib, and crizotinib are also recommended as 
first-line therapy options in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC (see 
Brigatinib and Crizotinib and Ceritinib in this Discussion). For the 2020 
update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel preference stratified the 
first-line therapy regimens and decided that brigatinib and ceritinib are 
“other recommended” options for patients with ALK-positive metastatic 
NSCLC; the panel decided that crizotinib is useful in certain 
circumstances. 
Subsequent Therapy 
Phase 2 trials assessed alectinib in patients with ALK-positive metastatic 
NSCLC who had progressed on crizotinib; overall response rates were 
48% to 50%.156,802 In the larger trial (138 patients), patients on alectinib 
had a response rate of 50% (95% CI, 41%–59%), and median duration of 
response of 11.2 months (95% CI, 9.6–not reached).156 For CNS disease, 
the control rate was 83% (95% CI, 74%–91%) and the median duration of 
response was 10.3 months (95% CI, 7.6–11.2). Of 84 patients with 
baseline CNS metastases, 23 (27%) had a complete CNS response to 
alectinib. Of 23 patients with baseline CNS metastases and no previous 
brain RT, 10 (43%) had a complete CNS response to alectinib. Most

adverse events were only grade 1 to 2 (constipation, fatigue, and 
peripheral edema); 4 patients (3%) had grade 3 dyspnea. One death due 
to intestinal perforation may have been related to alectinib. The NCCN 
NSCLC Panel recommends alectinib as a subsequent therapy option for 
patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who have progressed after crizotinib 
based on these trials and the FDA approval.156,801,802 Patients who do not 
tolerate crizotinib may be switched to alectinib, ceritinib, or brigatinib (if not 
previously given).  
Crizotinib 
Crizotinib inhibits ALK fusions, ROS1 fusions, and some MET tyrosine 
kinases (high-level MET amplification or METex14 skipping mutation); it is 
approved by the FDA for patients with metastatic NSCLC who have ALK 
gene fusions (ie, ALK-positive disease) or ROS1 fusions.150,252,289,803-807 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 4 agents for patients with 
ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC—alectinib, crizotinib, brigatinib, and 
ceritinib—based on clinical trial data and FDA approvals (see the Alectinib, 
Brigatinib, Ceritinib, and ALK Rearrangements in this Discussion and the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
crizotinib and entrectinib (both are preferred) for patients with 
ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC based on trial data and FDA approvals 
(see Entrectinib in this Discussion). The NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends ALK and ROS1 testing in certain patients with metastatic 
NSCLC based on data showing the efficacy of several agents for 
patients with ALK and ROS1 fusions and on the FDA approvals (see 
Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines 
for NSCLC).  
ALK Rearrangements 
Randomized phase 3 trials have compared crizotinib with first-line 
chemotherapy (PROFILE 1014) and with subsequent chemotherapy 
(PROFILE 1007).7,252,808 First-line therapy with crizotinib improved PFS, 
response rate (74% vs. 45%; P < .001), lung cancer symptoms, and 
quality of life when compared with chemotherapy (pemetrexed with either 
cisplatin or carboplatin).252 Crizotinib yields high response rates (>60%) 
when used in patients with advanced NSCLC who have ALK fusions, 
including those with brain metastases.107,252,809-811 Patients whose disease 
responds to crizotinib may have rapid improvement in symptoms; median 
time to progression on crizotinib is about 7 months to 1 year.812,813 
Crizotinib has relatively few side effects (eg, eye disorders, edema, 
transient changes in renal function).810,814,815 However, some patients have 
had pneumonitis; crizotinib should be discontinued in these patients.805 
Patients who do not tolerate crizotinib may be switched to alectinib, 
ceritinib, or brigatinib (if not previously given) unless an adverse side effect 
requiring discontinuation has occurred (eg, pneumonitis).  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends crizotinib as a first-line treatment 
option for patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC based on clinical 
trial data and the FDA approval.252 Crizotinib is a category 1 (useful in 
certain circumstances) option if an ALK rearrangement is discovered 
before giving first-line systemic therapy (eg, 
pembrolizumab/chemotherapy); it is a category 2A option if an ALK 
rearrangement is discovered during first-line systemic therapy. For the 
2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel preference stratified 
the first-line therapy regimens and decided that crizotinib is useful in 
certain circumstances for patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC. 
Alectinib is the preferred first-line therapy option for patients with 
ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC; brigatinib and ceritinib are “other 
recommended” options for ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC.  
Crizotinib may also be continued for patients with ALK fusions who have 
progressed on crizotinib, depending on the type of progression.804 
Recently, the NCCN NSCLC Panel deleted the option to continue 
crizotinib for patients with brain metastases who had progressed after

first-line therapy with crizotinib; the other ALK inhibitors are recommended 
options in this setting because they have better CNS response rates (ie, 
ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib).816-819 Subsequent therapy with crizotinib 
improved PFS (7.7 vs. 3.0 months; P < .001) and response rate (65% vs. 
20%; P < .001) when compared with single-agent therapy (either 
docetaxel or pemetrexed) in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who had 
progressed after first-line chemotherapy and had not previously received 
ALK inhibitors.804 
ROS1 Rearrangements 
Crizotinib is also very effective for patients with ROS1 fusions with 
response rates of about 70% to 80% including complete responses (see 
other section on ROS1 Rearrangements in this Discussion).150,151,269,273,274 
A phase 2 trial assessed crizotinib in 127 East Asian patients with 
ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC who had received 3 or fewer lines of 
therapy. The overall response rate was 72% (95% CI, 63%–79%) with 17 
complete responses; the median duration of response was 19.7 months 
(95% CI, 14.1–not reached). The median PFS was 15.9 months (95% CI, 
12.9–24.0).274  
PROFILE 1001, a phase 2 study, assessed crizotinib in 50 patients with 
advanced NSCLC who were positive for ROS1 fusions.151 Crizotinib 
yielded an objective response rate of 72% (95% CI, 58%–84%); there 
were 3 complete responses and 33 partial responses.151 The median 
duration of response was 17.6 months (95% CI, 14.5–not reached), and 
the median PFS was 19.2 months (95% CI, 14.4–not reached). Updated 
results from PROFILE 1001 reported an overall response rate of 72% 
(95% CI, 58%–83%) with crizotinib including 6 confirmed complete 
responses in 53 patients with ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC.14 The 
median overall survival was 51.4 months (95% CI, 29.3–not reached). No 
grade 4 or higher treatment-related adverse events were reported.  
The EUCROSS study reported crizotinib yielded an overall response rate 
of 70% (21/30; 95% CI, 51%–85%) in 30 patients with ROS1-positive 
advanced NSCLC.273 Adverse events related to treatment occurred in 97% 
(33/34) of patients. A retrospective European study in patients (n = 30 
evaluable) with stage IV NSCLC and ROS1 fusions also assessed 
crizotinib.150 There were 5 complete responses (overall response rate, 
80%; disease control rate, 86.7%). The median PFS was 9.1 months. 
Many patients (n = 26) received pemetrexed (either alone or in 
combination with platinum and either before or after crizotinib) and had a 
response rate of 57.7% and a median PFS of 7.2 months. The NCCN 
NSCLC Panel recommends ROS1 testing in certain patients with 
metastatic NSCLC based on data showing the efficacy of several agents 
for patients with ROS1 fusions and on the FDA approval (see Principles of 
Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).150,151,269 Crizotinib is a category 2A option (preferred) if a ROS1 
rearrangement is discovered before giving first-line systemic therapy (eg, 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy); crizotinib is a category 2A option 
(preferred) if an ROS1 rearrangement is discovered during first-line 
systemic therapy. The NCCN NSCLC Panel decided that crizotinib and 
entrectinib are the preferred agents for first-line therapy in patients with 
ROS1 fusions, compared with ceritinib, because they are better tolerated, 
have been assessed in more patients, and are approved by the FDA (see 
Ceritinib and Entrectinib in this Discussion). Lorlatinib is recommended in 
patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC whose disease becomes 
resistant to crizotinib, ceritinib, or entrectinib (see Lorlatinib in this 
Discussion).277  
Ceritinib 
Ceritinib is an oral TKI that inhibits ALK and ROS1 fusions.820

MS-47 
ALK Rearrangements  
ASCEND-4, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed ceritinib versus 
platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy for patients with 
ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC.253 PFS was improved when using 
ceritinib compared with platinum-based chemotherapy; the median PFS 
was 16.6 months (95% CI, 12.6–27.2) for ceritinib and 8.1 months (95% 
CI, 5.8–11.1) for chemotherapy (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.42–0.73; P < 
.00001). For ceritinib, common adverse events included diarrhea (85% 
[160/189] of patients), nausea (69% [130/189]), vomiting (66% [125/189]), 
and an increase in ALT (60% [114/189]). For chemotherapy, common 
adverse events included nausea (55% [97/175 patients]), vomiting (36% 
[63/175]), and anemia (35% [62/175]).  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends ceritinib as a first-line therapy 
option for patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC based on clinical 
trial data and the FDA approval.253,821-823 Ceritinib is a category 1 (other 
recommended) option if an ALK rearrangement is discovered before giving 
first-line systemic therapy (eg, pembrolizumab/chemotherapy); ceritinib is 
a category 2A option if an ALK rearrangement is discovered during 
first-line systemic therapy. For the 2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN 
NSCLC Panel preference stratified the first-line therapy regimens and 
decided that ceritinib and brigatinib are “other recommended” options for 
patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC; alectinib is the preferred 
first-line therapy option for ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC. The panel 
also decided that crizotinib is useful in certain circumstances.  
ASCEND-5, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed subsequent therapy 
with ceritinib versus chemotherapy (with pemetrexed or docetaxel) in 
patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC who had previously received 
at least 2 or more treatments (including chemotherapy and crizotinib) and 
had progressed.818 Patients receiving ceritinib had a significant 
improvement in median PFS when compared with chemotherapy (5.4 
months [95% CI, 4.1–6.9] for ceritinib vs. 1.6 months [95% CI, 1.4–2.8] for 
chemotherapy; HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.36–0.67; P < .0001). Serious adverse 
events were reported in 43% (49/115) of patients receiving ceritinib versus 
32% (36/113) of those receiving chemotherapy. ASCEND-2, a phase 2 
study, assessed ceritinib in patients who had previously received at least 2 
or more treatments, had progressed on crizotinib, and had brain 
metastases.817 The overall response rate was 38%; the duration of 
response was 9.7 months (95% CI, 7.1–11.1).817 The intracranial overall 
response rate was 45.0% (95% CI, 23.1%–68.5%), the NCCN NSCLC 
Panel recommends ceritinib as a subsequent therapy option (category 
2A) for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who have progressed after 
crizotinib based on clinical trial data and the FDA approval.817,818,821-823 
Patients who do not tolerate crizotinib may be switched to alectinib, 
ceritinib, or brigatinib (if not previously given). 
ROS1 Rearrangements 
A phase 2 trial assessed ceritinib as first-line therapy in patients (n = 28 
evaluable) with NSCLC and ROS1 fusions.820 One complete response and 
19 partial responses (overall response rate, 62% [95% CI, 45%–77%]) 
were reported in patients receiving ceritinib. PFS was 19.3 months (95% 
CI, 1–37) for crizotinib-naıve patients and 9.3 months (95% CI, 0–22) for 
all patients. The median overall survival was 24 months (95% CI, 5–43). 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends ceritinib (category 2A) for patients 
with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC based on this trial. Ceritinib is a 
category 2A (other recommended) option if an ROS1 rearrangement is 
discovered before giving first-line systemic therapy (eg, 
pembrolizumab/chemotherapy); ceritinib is a category 2A option if a ROS1 
rearrangement is discovered during first-line systemic therapy. For the 
2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel preference stratified 
the first-line therapy regimens and decided that ceritinib is an “other 
recommended” option for patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC.

preferred agents for first-line therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC 
and ROS1 fusions because they are better tolerated, have been assessed 
in more patients, and are approved by the FDA (see Crizotinib and 
Entrectinib in this Discussion). Lorlatinib is recommended in patients with 
ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC whose disease becomes resistant to 
crizotinib, ceritinib, or entrectinib.277  
Brigatinib  
Brigatinib is an oral TKI that inhibits ALK fusions.  
First-Line Therapy  
ALTA-1L, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed brigatinib versus crizotinib 
as first-line therapy for patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC.254 
PFS was increased in patients receiving brigatinib (67%; 95% CI, 56%–
75%) versus those receiving crizotinib (43%; 95% CI, 32%–53%) (HR for 
disease progression or death, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.33–0.74; P < .001). 
Intracranial response was also increased with brigatinib (78%; 95% CI, 
52%–94%) versus crizotinib (29%; 95% CI, 11%–52%). The NCCN 
NSCLC Panel recommends brigatinib as a first-line therapy option for 
patients with ALK-positive NSCLC based on clinical trial data and FDA 
approval.254 Brigatinib is a category 1 (other recommended) option if an 
ALK rearrangement is discovered before giving first-line systemic therapy 
(eg, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy); brigatinib is a category 2A option 
if an ALK rearrangement is discovered during first-line systemic therapy. 
For the 2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel preference 
stratified the first-line therapy regimens and decided that brigatinib and 
ceritinib are “other recommended” options for patients with ALK-positive 
metastatic NSCLC; alectinib is the preferred first-line therapy option for 
ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC. The panel decided that crizotinib is useful 
in certain circumstances.  
 
Subsequent Therapy 
ALTA, a phase 2 study, assessed 2 different doses of brigatinib: 90 mg 
(arm A) or 180 mg (arm B) every day—in patients with ALK-positive 
metastatic NSCLC who had progressed on or were intolerant to 
crizotinib.824,825 The overall response rates were 45% (97% CI, 34%–56%) 
and 54% (97% CI, 43%–65%) in arms A and B, respectively. Many 
patients had brain metastases (71% and 67%, respectively). The 
intracranial overall response rates were 42% (11/26) and 67% (12/18), 
respectively, in patients with measureable brain metastases. The median 
PFS was 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.4–15.6) and 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.1–
not reached), respectively. Grade 3 or higher adverse events included 
hypertension (6% and 6%, respectively) and pneumonia (3% and 5%, 
respectively). The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends brigatinib (category 
2A) as a subsequent therapy option for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC 
who have progressed after crizotinib based on clinical trial data and the 
FDA approval.824,825 Patients receiving brigatinib should be carefully 
monitored for respiratory symptoms, especially during the first week of 
treatment. Patients who do not tolerate crizotinib may be switched to 
alectinib, brigatinib, or ceritinib (if not previously given).  
Lorlatinib  
Lorlatinib is an oral third-generation TKI that targets ALK and ROS1 
tyrosine kinases and has good CNS penetration; it inhibits a broad range 
of ALK resistance mutations that develop after treatment with first- and 
second-generation ALK inhibitors.744,745  
Subsequent Therapy 
Data show that lorlatinib is effective in select patients who have 
progressed after treatment with ALK inhibitors, including those with CNS 
metastases.744,745 A phase 2 trial assessed lorlatinib in patients with 
ALK-positive or ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC who had progressed 
after ALK inhibitor therapy; many patients had asymptomatic CNS

metastases.744 In patients who had received at least one previous ALK 
inhibitor, objective responses were achieved in 47% of patients (93/198; 
95% CI, 39.9%–54.2%); there were 4 complete responses and 89 partial 
responses. In those with measurable baseline CNS lesions, an objective 
intracranial response was observed in 63% of patients (51/81; 95% CI, 
51.5%–73.4%). Lorlatinib was effective in patients who had received up to 
3 previous ALK inhibitors. Grade 3 to 4 adverse events included 
hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia (43/275 [16%] for both). 
Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 7% of patients 
(19/275) including cognitive effects in 1% (2/275); the cognitive effects 
resulted in permanent discontinuation of lorlatinib. No treatment-related 
deaths were reported. 
A phase 1 to 2 trial assessed lorlatinib in patients with ROS1-positive 
metastatic NSCLC.277 Many patients (58% [40/69]) had previously 
received crizotinib; some patients were TKI naïve (30% [21/69]). Objective 
responses were achieved in 35% (14/40) of patients who had previously 
received crizotinib and 62% (13/21) of TKI-naïve patients. An intracranial 
response was observed in 50% (12/24) of patients who had previously 
received crizotinib and 64% (7/11) of TKI-naïve patients. Serious 
treatment-related adverse events occurred in 7% (5/69) of patients; no 
treatment-related deaths were reported.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends lorlatinib (category 2A) as a 
subsequent therapy option for select patients with ALK-positive NSCLC 
who have progressed after treatment with ALK inhibitors based on clinical 
trial data and FDA approval.277,745 Lorlatinib is a subsequent therapy option 
for select patients with ALK-positive NSCLC after progression on either 
alectinib, brigatinib, or ceritinib depending on the type of progression. 
Lorlatinib is also a subsequent therapy option for select patients with 
ALK-positive NSCLC after progression on crizotinib followed by 
progression on either alectinib, brigatinib, or ceritinib. The NCCN NSCLC 
Panel also recommends lorlatinib (category 2A) as a subsequent therapy 
option for select patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC who have 
progressed after treatment with crizotinib, entrectinib, or ceritinib.277  
Oral TKIs That Inhibit BRAF Mutations 
Dabrafenib and Trametinib 
Dabrafenib and trametinib inhibit kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK 
pathway.168,169 Dabrafenib inhibits BRAF harboring V600E mutations; 
trametinib inhibits MEK 1/2, which is downstream of BRAF signaling.  
A phase 2 trial assessed first-line combination therapy with 
dabrafenib/trametinib for 36 patients with metastatic NSCLC and BRAF 
V600E mutations.826 The overall response rate was 64% (23/36; 95% CI, 
46%–79%); there were 2 complete responses. The median PFS was 10.9 
months (95% CI, 7.0–16.6). Many patients (69% [25/36]) had one or more 
grade 3 or 4 adverse events. Serious adverse events included increased 
ALT (14% [5/36]), increased AST (8% [3/36]), pyrexia (11% [4/36]), and 
decreased ejection fraction (8% [3/36]).  
A phase 2 study assessed the dabrafenib/trametinib regimen as 
subsequent therapy in 57 patients with advanced NSCLC and BRAF 
V600E mutations who had progressed on chemotherapy.168,827 Patients 
had a response rate of 63% (36/57) with dabrafenib/trametinib; however, 
considerable toxicity was reported. PFS was 9.7 months (6.9–19.6). 
Serious adverse events occurred in 56% (32/57) of patients, including 
pyrexia, anemia, confusional state, hemoptysis, hypercalcemia, and 
cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Grade 3 to 4 adverse events 
included neutropenia in 9% of patients (5/57), hyponatremia in 7% (4/57), 
and anemia in 5% (3/57). Four patients died during the study, but these 
deaths were not felt to be related to treatment (deaths were due to 
retroperitoneal hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, respiratory 
distress, or severe disease progression). Preliminary data from an

MS-50 
updated analysis of this phase 2 trial reported that patients receiving 
dabrafenib/trametinib had a median overall survival of 18.2 months (95% 
CI, 14.3–not reached).828 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends BRAF mutation testing in certain 
patients with metastatic NSCLC based on data showing the efficacy of 
several agents for patients with BRAF mutations and on the FDA 
approvals (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).826-829 The NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends combination therapy with dabrafenib/trametinib as preferred 
first-line therapy for patients with metastatic NSCLC and BRAF V600E 
mutations based on these trials and the FDA approval.826,828,829 
Single-agent therapy with dabrafenib or vemurafenib is also an option 
(other recommended) for patients with BRAF V600E mutations who do not 
tolerate combination therapy with dabrafenib/trametinib.169,828,830 Other 
systemic therapy regimens are also recommended (useful in certain 
circumstances) for patients with BRAF V600E mutations; the same initial 
systemic regimens used for patients with metastatic NSCLC may be used 
(eg, carboplatin/paclitaxel). For the 2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN 
NSCLC Panel preference stratified the first-line therapy regimens for 
patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC and 
decided that: 1) dabrafenib/trametinib is the preferred option; 2) dabrafenib 
or vemurafenib are “other recommended” options; and 3) other systemic 
therapy regimens (eg, carboplatin/paclitaxel) are useful in certain 
circumstances. If patients with BRAF V600E mutations have not received 
dabrafenib/trametinib as first-line therapy and have progressed after 
first-line systemic therapy regimens (eg, carboplatin/paclitaxel), then the 
NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends dabrafenib/trametinib as subsequent 
therapy.168,827  
 
Oral TKIs that Inhibit NTRK and ROS1 Fusions 
Larotrectinib 
NTRK gene fusions encode TRK fusion proteins that act as oncogenic 
drivers for various solid tumors, including lung, salivary gland, thyroid, and 
sarcoma (see NTRK Gene Fusions in this Discussion).284 Larotrectinib is 
an oral TKI that inhibits TRK fusion proteins across a diverse range of 
solid tumors in younger and older patients with unresectable or metastatic 
disease; thus, larotrectinib is referred to as an age- and tumor-agnostic 
therapy.284 A study in 55 patients with NTRK gene fusion–positive disease 
across a range of solid tumors showed that larotrectinib yielded an overall 
response rate of 75% (95% CI, 61%–85%).284 An updated analysis of this 
study showed that 90% of patients were still alive after 1 year, 18% of 
patients had a complete response, 69% of patients were still responding, 
and 58% of patients had not progressed.287 An additional 35 patients with 
NTRK gene fusion–positive disease had an overall response rate of 
74%.287 Fewer than 3% of patients had adverse events of grade 3 to 4.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends larotrectinib (category 2A) as 
either a first-line or subsequent therapy option for patients with NTRK 
gene fusion–positive metastatic NSCLC based on these data and the FDA 
approval.284,287 For the 2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel 
preference stratified the systemic therapy regimens and decided that 
larotrectinib and entrectinib are preferred first-line therapy options for 
NTRK gene fusion–positive metastatic NSCLC. Other systemic therapy 
regimens are also recommended (useful in certain circumstances) as 
first-line therapy options for patients with NTRK gene fusions; the same 
initial systemic regimens used for patients with metastatic NSCLC may be 
used (eg, carboplatin/paclitaxel). Larotrectinib may be used as subsequent 
therapy if it or entrectinib were not previously given as first-line therapy for

Entrectinib 
Entrectinib is an oral TKI that inhibits several tyrosine kinases including 
ROS1 and TRK (see ROS1 rearrangements and NTRK Gene Fusions in 
this Discussion).276,831 Entrectinib has been assessed in several phase 1 
and 2 trials in patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC (phase 2 
STARTRK-2 trial, phase 1 STARTRK-1 trial, and phase 1 ALKA-372-001 
trial).268,832 Pooled data from these 3 trials in 53 patients with 
ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC receiving first-line entrectinib showed an 
overall response rate of 77% (41/53; 95% CI, 64%–88%; 3 complete 
responses).268 The intracranial overall response rate was 55% (95% CI, 
32%–77%; 4 complete responses, 7 partial responses).268,832 In the larger 
ROS1 population (n = 134), grade 3 to 4 adverse events were seen in 
34% of patients. Fifteen patients had serious adverse events such as 
nervous system disorders (4 patients [3%]) and cardiac disorders (3 
patients [2%]). No treatment-related deaths were reported. Although 
entrectinib has better CNS penetration than crizotinib, it is more toxic.  
Similar to larotrectinib, entrectinib inhibits TRK fusion proteins across a 
range of solid tumors in young and older patients with unresectable or 
metastatic disease; thus, entrectinib is also an age- and tumor-agnostic 
therapy. Entrectinib has been assessed in several phase 1 and 2 trials in 
patients with NTRK gene fusion–positive metastatic NSCLC (phase 2 
STARTRK-2 trial, phase 1 STARTRK-1 trial, and phase 1 ALKA-372-001 
trial).268,286,832 Pooled data from these 3 trials in 10 patients with NTRK 
gene fusion–positive NSCLC showed that entrectinib yielded an overall 
response rate of 70% (95% CI, 35%–93%; 7/10: 7/7 adenocarcinoma 
NSCLC, 0/3 squamous cell carcinoma, unclassified, or undifferentiated 
NSCLC); there was one complete response.275 Most patients (70%) with 
NTRK gene fusion–positive NSCLC had received one or more lines of 
previous therapy. In 6 patients with CNS disease, entrectinib yielded an 
intracranial response rate of 67% (4/6; 2 complete responses and 2 partial 
responses). Grade 3 adverse events with entrectinib across a range of 
solid tumors included anemia and increased weight. Grade 4 adverse 
events occurred in 3 patients (ie, increased AST, increased ALT, blood 
uric acid, hyperuricemia). Nervous system disorders were the most 
common serious treatment-related adverse event (4% [3/68] and 3% 
[10/355]). No treatment-related deaths were reported.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends entrectinib as a first-line therapy 
option for patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC (category 2A; 
preferred) and also recommends entrectinib as either a first-line or 
subsequent therapy option for NTRK gene fusion–positive metastatic 
NSCLC (category 2A) based on these data and the FDA 
approval.268,275,276,832 For the 2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC 
Panel preference stratified the systemic therapy regimens and decided 
that entrectinib and larotrectinib are preferred first-line therapy options for 
NTRK gene fusion–positive metastatic NSCLC. Other systemic therapy 
regimens are also recommended (useful in certain circumstances) for 
patients with NTRK gene fusions; the same initial systemic regimens used 
for patients with metastatic NSCLC may be used (eg, 
carboplatin/paclitaxel). Subsequent therapy with lorlatinib is also 
recommended (category 2A) for select patients with ROS1-positive 
metastatic NSCLC who have progressed after treatment with crizotinib, 
ceritinib, or entrectinib. Entrectinib may be used as subsequent therapy if it 
or larotrectinib were not previously given as first-line therapy for NTRK 
gene fusion–positive metastatic NSCLC. 
Oral TKIs that Inhibit MET Exon 14 Skipping Mutations 
Capmatinib 
Capmatinib is an oral TKI that selectively inhibits MET genomic 
alterations. Oncogenic driver genomic alterations in MET include 
METex14 skipping mutations, MET gene copy number (GCN) gain or 
amplification, and MET protein overexpression (see MET Genomic

Alterations in this Discussion). Capmatinib has been assessed in phase 1 
and 2 studies of patients with advanced NSCLC.294,833,834  
GEOMETRY, a phase 2 study, assessed capmatinib in different cohorts of 
patients with MET genomic alterations, including those with METex14 
skipping mutations; patients had stage IIIB/IV NSCLC and were wild-type 
for EGFR and ALK genomic alterations.294 Preliminary data from 
GEOMETRY show that first-line therapy with capmatinib yielded an overall 
response rate of 71.4% (95% CI, 51.3%–86.8%) in 28 patients with 
METex14 skipping mutations; the median PFS was 9.13 months (5.52–
13.9 months) for first-line therapy. Subsequent therapy with capmatinib 
yielded an overall response rate of 39.1% (95% CI, 27.6%–51.6%) in 69 
patients with METex14 skipping mutations; the median PFS was 5.42 
months (95% CI, 4.17–6.97 months) for subsequent therapy. Common 
adverse events across all cohorts included peripheral edema (49%), 
nausea (43%), and vomiting (28%), but most events were grades 1 to 2. 
Updated results from GEOMETRY suggest that capmatinib is effective for 
patients with brain metastases.833 Of patients with brain metastases, 54% 
(7/13) responded to capmatinib; 4 patients had a complete response in the 
brain. 
For the 2020 update (Version 4), the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
capmatinib as either a first-line therapy or subsequent therapy option 
(category 2A; preferred) for patients with metastatic NSCLC who are 
positive for METex14 skipping mutations based on preliminary data and 
the FDA approval.294,833 The NCCN NSCLC Panel also preference 
stratified regimens that are recommended for METex14 skipping 
mutations and decided that capmatinib is a preferred first-line therapy or 
subsequent therapy option for METex14 skipping mutation–positive 
metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial data. Capmatinib may be used as 
subsequent therapy if it or crizotinib were not previously given as first-line 
therapy for METex14 skipping mutation–positive metastatic NSCLC. The 
panel decided that crizotinib is useful in certain circumstances as either a 
first-line therapy or subsequent therapy option for METex14 skipping 
mutation–positive metastatic NSCLC (see next paragraph on Crizotinib).295 
Other systemic therapy regimens are also recommended as useful in 
certain circumstances for first-line therapy for patients with metastatic 
NSCLC who are positive for METex14 skipping mutation; these systemic 
regimens include platinum doublets, such as carboplatin/paclitaxel. These 
platinum doublets may be used as subsequent therapy for patients who 
have progressed on capmatinib or crizotinib. Patients with METex14 
skipping mutations and high PD-L1 expression do not respond to 
immunotherapy, even those with high PD-L1 levels.249,293  
Crizotinib  
Crizotinib is an oral TKI that inhibits some MET tyrosine kinases 
(high-level MET amplification or METex14 skipping mutation), ALK 
fusions, and ROS1 fusions; it is approved by the FDA for patients with 
metastatic NSCLC who have ALK or ROS1 fusions. A phase 2 study 
assessed crizotinib in 69 patients with advanced NSCLC who were 
positive for METex14 skipping mutations.295 The objective response rate 
was 32% (95% CI, 21%–45%). Median PFS was 7.3 months (95% CI, 
5.4–9.1 months). For the 2020 update (Version 4), the NCCN NSCLC 
Panel recommends crizotinib as a first-line therapy or subsequent therapy 
option (category 2A; useful in certain circumstances) for patients with 
metastatic NSCLC who are positive for METex14 skipping mutations 
based on this data.295 Crizotinib may be used as subsequent therapy if it 
or capmatinib were not previously given as first-line therapy for METex14 
skipping mutation–positive metastatic NSCLC. However, the panel voted 
that capmatinib is preferred in the first-line setting for METex14 skipping 
mutation–positive metastatic NSCLC (see previous paragraph on 
Capmatinib).294

Oral TKIs that Inhibit RET Rearrangements 
Selpercatinib 
Selpercatinib (LOXO-292) is an oral TKI that selectively inhibits RET 
rearrangements. Libretto-001, a phase 1/2 study, assessed selpercatinib 
in patients with metastatic NSCLC and RET rearrangements.303 
Preliminary data from Libretto-001 show that first-line therapy with 
selpercatinib yielded an overall response rate of 85% (29/34; 95% CI, 
69%–95%). Second-line therapy with selpercatinib yielded an overall 
response rate of 68% (71/105; 95% CI, 58%–76%); the median PFS was 
18.4 months (95% CI, 12.9–24.9). Of patients with brain metastases, 91% 
(10/11) responded to selpercatinib. Common adverse events with 
selpercatinib include dry mouth (32%), diarrhea (31%), hypertension (29%), 
and increased liver enzyme levels (27%). Only 1.7% of patients (9/531) had to 
stop taking selpercatinib because of side effects.  
For the 2020 update (Version 4), the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
selpercatinib as a first-line or subsequent therapy option (category 2A; 
preferred) for patients with metastatic NSCLC who are positive for RET 
rearrangements based on this preliminary data and the FDA approval for 
selpercatinib.303,833 Selpercatinib may be used as subsequent therapy if it 
or other RET inhibitors were not previously given as first-line therapy for 
RET rearrangement–positive metastatic NSCLC.  
Pralsetinib 
Pralsetinib is an oral TKI that selectively inhibits RET rearrangements. 
ARROW, a phase 1/2 study, assessed pralsetinib in patients with 
metastatic NSCLC and RET rearrangements.302 Preliminary data from 
ARROW show that first-line therapy with pralsetinib yielded an overall 
response rate of 66% (19/29; 95% CI, 46%–82%); 10% of patients had a 
complete response. Second-line therapy with pralsetinib yielded an overall 
response rate of 55% (50/92; 95% CI, 45%–66%); 6% of patients had a 
complete response. Nine patients had measurable brain metastases, and 
56% responded to pralsetinib; 3 patients had an intracranial complete 
response. Grade 3 or higher adverse events with pralsetinib include anemia 
(8%), neutropenia (10%), and hypertension (10%). Common adverse events 
with pralsetinib included increased AST levels (31%), increased ALT levels 
(21%), anemia (22%), hypertension (20%), constipation (21%), and 
neutropenia (19%). Only 4% of patients (5/132) had to stop taking pralsetinib 
because of side effects.  
For the 2020 update (Version 7), the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
pralsetinib as a first-line or subsequent therapy option (category 2A; 
preferred) for patients with metastatic NSCLC who are positive for RET 
rearrangements based on this preliminary data and the FDA approval for  
pralsetinib.302 Pralsetinib may be used as subsequent therapy if it or other 
RET inhibitors were not previously given as first-line therapy for RET 
rearrangement–positive metastatic NSCLC. 
Cabozantinib and Vandetanib  
Cabozantinib and vandetanib are oral TKIs that inhibit RET 
rearrangements but also inhibit other kinases. A phase 2 study assessed 
cabozantinib in 26 patients.152,304,835 The overall response rate was 28% 
(95% CI, 12%–49%). Many patients (19 [73%]) needed dose reductions 
because of adverse events. The most common grade 3 adverse events 
included lipase elevation (4 patients [15%]), increased ALT (2 [8%]), 
decreased platelet count (2 [8%]), and hypophosphatemia (2 [8%]). The 
NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends cabozantinib as a first-line therapy or 
subsequent therapy option (category 2A; useful in certain circumstances) 
for RET rearrangement–positive metastatic NSCLC based on this 
data.152,304  
A phase 2 study assessed vandetanib in 18 patients with NSCLC with 
RET rearrangements who had received 2 or more previous chemotherapy 
regimens.746,836 The overall survival was 11.6 months and the PFS was 4.5

months. Partial remission (18%) was reported in 3 patients; stable disease 
was reported in another 8 patients. The disease control rate was 65%. Six 
(33%) patients died within 3 months of enrollment of the study due to rapid 
tumor progression. The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends vandetanib as 
a first-line therapy or subsequent therapy option (category 2B; as useful in 
certain circumstances) for RET rearrangement–positive metastatic NSCLC 
based on this data.746 Cabozantinib or vandetanib may be used as 
subsequent therapy if they or other RET inhibitors were not previously 
given as first-line therapy for RET rearrangement–positive metastatic 
NSCLC. 
Preference Stratification 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel preference stratified the regimens that are 
recommended for RET rearrangements and decided that selpercatinib and 
pralsetinib are preferred first-line therapy or subsequent therapy options 
for RET rearrangement–positive metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial 
data.302,303,833 The panel decided that cabozantinib (category 2A) and 
vandetanib (category 2B) are both useful in certain circumstances as 
either first-line therapy or subsequent therapy options for RET 
rearrangements based on clinical trial data 152,304,835 Selpercatinib, 
pralsetinib, cabozantinib, or vandetanib may be used as subsequent 
therapy if they were not previously given as first-line therapy for RET 
rearrangement–positive metastatic NSCLC. Other systemic therapy 
regimens (category 2A; other recommended regimens) are also 
recommended as first-line therapy options for patients with metastatic 
NSCLC who are positive for RET rearrangements; these systemic 
regimens include platinum doublets, such as carboplatin/paclitaxel. These 
platinum doublets may be used as subsequent therapy for patients who 
have progressed on selpercatinib, pralsetinib, cabozantinib, or vandetanib. 
Patients with RET rearrangements have minimal response (6%) to 
immunotherapy.249 
EGFR Inhibitor: Monoclonal Antibody 
Cetuximab 
Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets EGFR. FLEX, a large 
phase 3 randomized trial, assessed cisplatin/vinorelbine with (or without) 
cetuximab for patients with advanced NSCLC; most patients had stage IV 
disease.837 Adding cetuximab was reported to slightly increase overall 
survival (11.3 vs. 10.1 months; HR for death, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.762–0.996; 
P = .044). Patients receiving cetuximab had increased grade 4 events 
versus control (62% vs. 52%, P < .01); cetuximab was also associated 
with grade 2 acne-like rash.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel does not recommend the cetuximab plus 
cisplatin plus vinorelbine regimen based on the clinical data.837 The 
benefits of this cetuximab-based regimen are very slight, it is a difficult 
regimen to administer, and patients have poorer tolerance for this regimen 
when compared with other regimens; for example, almost 40% of patients 
have grade 4 neutropenia.643 Patients may also have comorbid conditions 
that prevent them from receiving cisplatin such as poor kidney function. 
Cisplatin/vinorelbine with (or without) cetuximab is generally not used in 
the United States because of concerns about toxicity.643,661,837 Although the 
FLEX trial results were reported to be statistically significant, they were not 
clinically significant.643 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recently deleted the 
cisplatin/vinorelbine and carboplatin/vinorelbine regimens from the list of 
recommended cytotoxic therapy options for patients with metastatic 
NSCLC with all histologies.  
Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors  
Human ICI antibodies inhibit the PD-1 receptor or PD-L1, which improves 
antitumor immunity; PD-1 receptors are expressed on activated cytotoxic 
T cells.309-311 ICIs (also known as immunotherapy or immuno-oncology [IO] 
agents) are associated with a delay in benefit when compared with 
targeted therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapy. The single-agent

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
 
MS-55 
immunotherapy or combination immunotherapy/chemotherapy regimens 
are not recommended if patients have contraindications to 
immunotherapy, which may include active or previously documented 
autoimmune disease, current use of immunosuppressive agents, or 
presence of an oncogene that would predict lack of benefit. Nivolumab 
and pembrolizumab inhibit PD-1 receptors;312,121 atezolizumab and 
durvalumab inhibit PD-L1.313,314  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends (category 1) IHC testing for PD-L1 
expression before first-line treatment in all patients with metastatic NSCLC 
based on the efficacy of pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy 
(see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC and Pembrolizumab in this Discussion).315 Ideally, 
PD-L1 expression levels are assessed before first-line therapy in patients 
with metastatic NSCLC, if clinically feasible. Every effort also needs to be 
made to assess for oncogenic driver variants for which targeted 
therapies are available (eg, EGFR mutations, ALK fusions). It is 
important to note that targeted therapies are recommended for patients 
with metastatic NSCLC and specific oncogenic drivers, independent of 
PD-L1 levels. Patients with metastatic NSCLC and PD-L1 expression 
levels of 1% or more—but who also have a targetable driver oncogene 
molecular variant (eg, EGFR, ALK, ROS1)—should receive first-line 
targeted therapy for that oncogene and not first-line ICIs because 
targeted therapies yield higher response rates (eg, osimertinib, 80%) 
than ICIs (poor response rates) in the first-line setting, targeted therapy 
is better tolerated, and these patients are unlikely to respond to 
ICIs.249,321-323,751 For patients receiving first-line ICIs with or without 
chemotherapy, oncologists should be aware of the long half-life of the 
ICIs and potential adverse effects when combining ICIs with 
osimertinib.763-765 
The following content briefly summarizes the use of ICIs as first-line or 
subsequent therapy in eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC; detailed 
information, including clinical trial data, is provided in subsequent sections 
(see Pembrolizumab, Atezolizumab, and Nivolumab with or Without 
Ipilimumab in this Discussion); durvalumab is discussed in a different 
section, because it is used for eligible patients with unresectable stage III 
NSCLC (see Durvalumab in this Discussion).  
Single-agent pembrolizumab is recommended (category 1; preferred) as 
first-line therapy for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC regardless of 
histology, PD-L1 expression levels of 50% or more, and with negative test 
results for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, METex14 skipping, and BRAF V600E 
(specific molecular) variants. The NCCN NSCLC Panel also recommends 
single-agent pembrolizumab as a first-line therapy option in eligible 
patients with metastatic NSCLC regardless of histology, PD-L1 levels of 
1% to 49% (category 2B; useful in certain circumstances), and negative 
test results for specific molecular variants (see Pembrolizumab in this 
Discussion).838 Combination therapy with pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy is recommended (category 1; preferred) as a first-line 
therapy option in eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC and negative test 
results for specific molecular variants, regardless of PD-L1 expression 
levels. Combination therapy with the ABCP regimen is recommended 
(category 1; other recommended intervention) as a first-line therapy option 
for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC and negative test results for 
specific molecular variants, regardless of PD-L1 expression levels. 
Maintenance immunotherapy is recommended, if tolerated, for 2 years for 
all the first-line regimens. Durvalumab is recommended (category 1) as 
consolidation immunotherapy by the NCCN NSCLC Panel for eligible 
patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC who have not progressed after 
treatment with definitive concurrent chemoradiation; clinical trial data and 
appropriate use for durvalumab are described in greater detail elsewhere 
(see Durvalumab in this Discussion).313

MS-56 
If patients have progressed on PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy (with or 
without chemotherapy), then switching to a different PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor 
is not recommended for subsequent therapy. Single-agent pembrolizumab 
is recommended (category 1; preferred) as a subsequent therapy option 
for select patients with metastatic NSCLC and PD-L1 levels greater than 
1%; nivolumab or atezolizumab is recommended (category 1; preferred) 
as a subsequent monotherapy option for select patients with metastatic 
NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 levels (see Pembrolizumab, Atezolizumab, 
and Nivolumab with or Without Ipilimumab in this Discussion). Based on 
data in the second-line setting, PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy 
appears to be less effective in patients with EGFR mutations or ALK 
fusions regardless of PD-L1 expression levels.309,312,751,839,840 A small study 
suggests that single-agent pembrolizumab is not effective as first-line 
therapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC and EGFR mutations, even 
those with PD-L1 levels more than 50%.322 Patients with ALK-positive 
NSCLC and very high PD-L1 expression levels do not respond to 
pembrolizumab.751 In the trials assessing the efficacy of first-line therapy 
with pembrolizumab with (or without) chemotherapy, most of the patients 
were wild type for EGFR or ALK variants. Maintenance immunotherapy is 
recommended, if tolerated, until progression for all the subsequent therapy 
regimens.  
ICIs are associated with unique immune-mediated adverse events, such 
as endocrine disorders, that are not seen with traditional cytotoxic 
chemotherapy; therefore, health care providers should be aware of the 
spectrum of potential immune-mediated adverse events, know how to 
manage the adverse events, and educate their patients about possible 
side effects (see the NCCN Guidelines for the Management of 
Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities, available at www.NCCN.org).841,842 
Pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, nivolumab, or durvalumab should be 
discontinued for patients with severe or life-threatening pneumonitis and 
should be withheld or discontinued for other severe or life-threatening 
immune-mediated adverse events when indicated (see prescribing 
information). Pseudoprogression has been reported; therefore, traditional 
RECIST criteria may not be applicable.843  
Pembrolizumab 
Pembrolizumab is a human ICI antibody that inhibits PD-1 receptors, 
which improves antitumor immunity.312,121 The NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends (category 1) IHC testing for PD-L1 expression before 
first-line treatment in all patients with metastatic NSCLC based on the 
efficacy of pembrolizumab (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker 
Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).315 The FDA has approved 
a companion diagnostic biomarker test for assessing PD-L1 expression 
and determining which patients are eligible for pembrolizumab therapy. 
Although it is not an optimal biomarker, PD-L1 expression is currently the 
best available biomarker to assess whether patients are candidates for 
pembrolizumab.316,317 PD-L1 expression is continuously variable and 
dynamic; thus, a cutoff value for a positive result is artificial. Patients with 
PD-L1 expression levels just below and just above 50% will probably have 
similar responses.316 Unique anti-PD-L1 IHC assays have been developed 
for each one of the different ICIs currently available.316,320 The definition of 
a positive PD-L1 test result varies depending on which biomarker assay is 
used.320  
Ideally, PD-L1 expression levels are assessed before first-line therapy in 
patients with metastatic NSCLC, if clinically feasible. Every effort also 
needs to be made to assess for specific oncogenic driver variants for 
which targeted therapies are available such as EGFR mutations and ALK 
variants. Plasma-based testing can be used to evaluate for EGFR 
mutations and ALK fusions, although these assays are less sensitive than 
tissue assays. It is important to note that targeted therapies are 
recommended for patients with metastatic NSCLC and specific oncogenic 
drivers, independent of PD-L1 levels. Patients with metastatic NSCLC and

PD-L1 expression levels of 1% or more—but who also have a targetable 
driver oncogene molecular variant (eg, EGFR, ALK, ROS1)—should 
receive first-line targeted therapy for that oncogene and not first-line ICIs 
because targeted therapies yield higher response rates (eg, osimertinib, 
80%) than ICIs (poor response rates) in the first-line setting, targeted 
therapy is better tolerated, and these patients are unlikely to respond to 
ICIs.249,321-324  
Immune-mediated adverse events may occur with pembrolizumab.844-846 
For patients with immune-mediated adverse events, intravenous 
high-dose corticosteroids should be administered based on the severity of 
the reaction (see the NCCN Guidelines for the Management of 
Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities, available at www.NCCN.org). 
Pembrolizumab should also be discontinued for patients with severe or 
life-threatening pneumonitis and should be withheld or discontinued for 
other severe or life-threatening immune-mediated adverse events when 
indicated (see prescribing information). 
First-Line Monotherapy 
KEYNOTE-024, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared single-agent 
pembrolizumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy 
for patients with advanced nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC and PD-L1 
expression levels of 50% or more, but without EGFR mutations or ALK 
fusions.9,121 At 6 months, the rate of overall survival was 80.2% with 
pembrolizumab monotherapy versus 72.4% with chemotherapy (HR for 
death, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41–0.89; P = .005). Reponses were higher for 
pembrolizumab than for chemotherapy (44.8% vs. 27.8%).121 An updated 
analysis of KEYNOTE-024 showed that median overall survival was 
increased with pembrolizumab monotherapy (30.0 months; 95% CI, 18.3 
months–not reached) compared with chemotherapy (14.2 months; 95% 
CI, 9.8–19.0 months; HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47–0.86).9 Fewer severe 
treatment-related adverse events (grades 3–5) were reported in patients 
receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy compared with those receiving 
chemotherapy (31.2% vs. 53.3%). Treatment-related deaths occurred in 
1.3% (2/154) of patients receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy versus 
2% (3/150) of patients receiving chemotherapy alone.  
KEYNOTE-042, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared single-agent 
pembrolizumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy 
for patients with advanced nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC and PD-L1 
expression levels of 1% or more, but without EGFR mutations or ALK 
fusions.838 Overall survival was longer in patients with PD-L1 levels of 50% 
or more who received single-agent pembrolizumab (20.0 months; 95% CI, 
15.4–24.9) compared with chemotherapy (12.2 months; 95% CI, 10.4–
14.2; HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56–0.85; P = .0003). In a subgroup analysis, 
overall survival was similar in patients with PD-L1 levels of 1% to 49% who 
received single-agent pembrolizumab (13.4 months; 95% CI, 10.7–18.2) 
compared with chemotherapy (12.1 months; 95% CI, 11.0–14.0) (HR, 
0.92; 95% CI, 0.77–1.11). Long-term data from KEYNOTE-001 show that 
5-year survival for patients with metastatic NSCLC is approximately 23% 
for patients who received first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy and 
15.5% for patients who received subsequent pembrolizumab 
monotherapy; for patients with PD-L1 levels of 50% or more, 5-year 
overall survival is about 29.6% and 25%, respectively.11 Median overall 
survival was 22.3 months (95% CI, 17.1–32.3) for treatment-naïve 
patients and 10.5 months (95% CI, 8.6–13.2) for patients previously 
treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy. For patients with metastatic 
NSCLC receiving chemotherapy alone, 5-year overall survival is 
approximately 6%.11  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends single-agent pembrolizumab 
(category 1; preferred) as a first-line therapy option for eligible patients 
with advanced nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC, PD-L1 expression 
levels of 50% or more, no contraindications to PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors,

and negative test results for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, METex14 skipping, RET, 
or BRAF variants based on clinical trial data and FDA approval.121,838,847 
Maintenance therapy with pembrolizumab is also a recommended option 
in this setting (category 1). For patients who progress on first-line therapy 
with single-agent pembrolizumab, subsequent therapy with initial 
cytotoxic systemic therapy regimens (eg, carboplatin/paclitaxel) is 
recommended by the NCCN NSCLC Panel.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel also recommends single-agent pembrolizumab 
as a first-line therapy option (category 2B; useful in certain 
circumstances) for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC, PD-L1 
expression levels of 1% to 49%, no contraindications to PD-1 or PD-L1 
inhibitors, and negative test results for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, METex14 
skipping, RET, or BRAF variants based on clinical trial data and FDA 
approval.838,847 The NCCN NSCLC Panel decided that single-agent 
pembrolizumab is a useful intervention in patients with PD-L1 levels of 1% 
to 49% who cannot tolerate or refuse platinum-based chemotherapy 
(category 2B; useful in certain circumstances). In patients with PD-L1 
levels of 1% to 49%, the HR of 0.92 is not statistically or clinically 
significant for pembrolizumab monotherapy versus chemotherapy; 
therefore, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is recommended (category 
1; preferred) if patients can tolerate the therapy. Maintenance therapy 
with pembrolizumab is also a recommended option in this setting 
(category 2B).  
First-Line Combination Therapy 
KEYNOTE-189, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared pembrolizumab 
added to carboplatin (or cisplatin)/pemetrexed versus chemotherapy in 
patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC.848 Most patients received 
pembrolizumab/carboplatin/pemetrexed (72% [445/616]) in this trial, but 
some received pembrolizumab plus cisplatin plus pemetrexed (28% 
[171/616]); patients did not have EGFR mutations or ALK fusions. The 
estimated rate of overall survival at one year was 69.2% (95% CI, 64.1%–
73.8%) in patients receiving pembrolizumab/chemotherapy versus 49.4% 
(95% CI, 42.1%–56.2%) for chemotherapy alone (HR for death, 0.49; 95% 
CI, 0.38–0.64; P < .001) after a median follow-up of 10.5 months. Overall 
survival was improved regardless of PD-L1 expression levels; TMB did not 
predict for response.849 For the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group, 
median PFS was 8.8 months (95% CI, 7.6–9.2) compared with 4.9 months 
(95% CI, 4.7–5.5) for chemotherapy alone (HR for disease progression or 
death, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43–0.64; P < .001). Grade 3 or higher adverse 
events occurred at a similar rate in both arms 
(pembrolizumab/chemotherapy, 67.2% vs. chemotherapy, 65.8%).  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed 
and either carboplatin or cisplatin (category 1; preferred) as a first-line 
therapy option for eligible patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC 
(ie, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma) or NSCLC NOS based on 
clinical trial data and on FDA approval.848,850 For the 2020 update (Version 
1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel preference stratified the systemic therapy 
regimens and decided that these pembrolizumab/chemotherapy regimens 
are preferred first-line options for eligible patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous NSCLC, regardless of their PD-L1 expression levels. These 
pembrolizumab/chemotherapy regimens are recommended (category 1; 
preferred) as first-line therapy options for patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous NSCLC, no contraindications to PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, 
and negative test results for EGFR, ALK, BRAF V600E, METex14 
skipping, RET, and ROS1 variants, regardless of their PD-L1 expression 
levels. Maintenance therapy with pembrolizumab/pemetrexed is also a 
recommended option (category 1) in this setting. For patients with 
metastatic NSCLC who progress on combination therapy with PD-1/PD-L1 
inhibitors/chemotherapy, subsequent therapy with docetaxel (with or 
without ramucirumab), pemetrexed (nonsquamous only), or gemcitabine is 
recommended if not previously given.

MS-59 
KEYNOTE-407, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared pembrolizumab 
added to carboplatin and either paclitaxel or albumin-bound paclitaxel in 
patients with metastatic squamous cell NSCLC; 32% of patients received 
albumin-bound paclitaxel (also known as nab-paclitaxel).851 Median 
overall survival was 15.9 months (95% CI, 13.2–not reached) with 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.5–
14.8) with chemotherapy alone (HR for death, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49–0.85; 
P < .001). Patients receiving pembrolizumab/chemotherapy had an 
overall response rate of 57.9% compared to 38.4% for those receiving 
chemotherapy alone. Only 38% of patients had a PD-L1 TPS less than 
1%. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were similar in both groups 
(pembrolizumab/chemotherapy, 69.8% vs. chemotherapy alone, 68.2%). 
Because of adverse events, more patients discontinued treatment with 
pembrolizumab/chemotherapy than with chemotherapy (13.3% vs. 6.4%, 
respectively). 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends pembrolizumab plus carboplatin 
and either paclitaxel or albumin-bound paclitaxel (category 1; preferred) 
as a first-line therapy option for patients with metastatic squamous cell 
NSCLC based on clinical trial data from and FDA approval.851,852 
Maintenance therapy with pembrolizumab is also a recommended option 
in this setting (category 1). For the 2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN 
NSCLC Panel preference stratified the systemic therapy regimens and 
decided that these pembrolizumab/chemotherapy regimens are preferred 
for eligible patients with metastatic squamous cell NSCLC, regardless of 
their PD-L1 expression levels. These pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
regimens are recommended (category 1; preferred) as first-line therapy 
options for patients with metastatic squamous cell NSCLC, no 
contraindications to PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, and negative test results for 
EGFR, ALK, BRAF V600E, METex14 skipping, RET, and ROS1 variants, 
regardless of their PD-L1 expression levels. For the 2020 update 
(Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel deleted the recommendation for 
the pembrolizumab/cisplatin with either paclitaxel or albumin-bound 
paclitaxel regimen, because there are less data for this regimen.  
Subsequent Therapy 
KEYNOTE-010, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared single-agent 
pembrolizumab in patients with previously treated advanced 
nonsquamous and squamous NSCLC who were PD-L1 positive (≥1%); 
most patients were current or former smokers.840 There were 3 arms in 
this trial: pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg, pembrolizumab at 10 mg/kg, and 
docetaxel at 75 mg/m² every 3 weeks. The median overall survival was 
10.4 months for the lower dose of pembrolizumab, 12.7 months for the 
higher dose, and 8.5 months for docetaxel. Overall survival was 
significantly longer for both doses of pembrolizumab versus docetaxel 
(pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg: HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58–0.88; P = .0008) 
(pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg: HR, 0.61; CI, 0.49–0.75; P < .0001). For those 
patients with at least 50% PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, overall survival 
was also significantly longer at either dose of pembrolizumab when 
compared with docetaxel (pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg: 14.9 vs. 8.2 months;  
HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.38–0.77; P = .0002) (pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg: 17.3 
vs. 8.2 months; HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.36–0.70; P < .0001). When compared 
with docetaxel, there were fewer grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse 
events at either dose of pembrolizumab (pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg: 13% 
[43/339] of patients, pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg: 16% [55/343] of patients; 
and docetaxel: 35% [109/309] of patients). A total of 6 treatment-related 
deaths occurred in patients receiving pembrolizumab (3 at each dose) and 
5 treatment-related deaths occurred in the docetaxel arm.  
If patients have not previously received a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, the NCCN 
NSCLC Panel recommends single-agent pembrolizumab (category 1; 
preferred) as a subsequent therapy option for patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC and PD-L1 expression levels of 1% or 
more based on clinical trial data and FDA approval.840,853,854 Testing for

PD-L1 expression levels is recommended before prescribing 
pembrolizumab monotherapy (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker 
Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).  
Atezolizumab 
Atezolizumab is a human ICI antibody that inhibits PD-L1, which improves 
antitumor immunity.314 Immune-mediated adverse events may occur with 
atezolizumab.839,855 For patients with immune-mediated adverse events, 
intravenous high-dose corticosteroids should be administered based on 
the severity of the reaction (see the NCCN Guidelines for the Management 
of Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities, available at www.NCCN.org). 
Atezolizumab should also be permanently discontinued for patients with 
severe or life-threatening pneumonitis and should be discontinued for 
other severe or life-threatening immune-mediated adverse events when 
indicated (see prescribing information). 
First-Line Therapy 
IMpower150, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared first-line therapy with 
the ABCP regimen for patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC 
versus bevacizumab plus chemotherapy.855 Median overall survival was 
19.2 months (95% CI, 17.0–23.8) in the ABCP arm versus 14.7 months 
(95% CI, 13.3–16.9) in the carboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab arm; the 
HR for death was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.64–0.96; P = .02). PFS was longer in 
the ABCP arm versus chemotherapy/bevacizumab (8.3 vs. 6.8 months; 
HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.52–0.74; P < .001). Some patients with EGFR 
mutations or ALK fusions (n = 108) who had progressed on (or were 
intolerant of) prior TKI were enrolled in this trial, although most patients 
(87%) did not have these genetic variants. In these patients with EGFR 
mutations or ALK fusions, PFS was also increased with ABCP compared 
with chemotherapy/bevacizumab (9.7 vs. 6.1 months; HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 
0.37–0.94). A subgroup analysis of IMpower150 reported that subsequent 
therapy with the ABCP regimen increased median overall survival in a few 
patients with EGFR mutation–positive metastatic NSCLC (n = 34) 
compared with those receiving carboplatin plus paclitaxel plus 
bevacizumab (n = 45).856 Therefore, the ABCP regimen may be an option 
for patients with EGFR mutations or ALK fusions who have progressed 
after initial therapy with TKIs.  
IMpower130, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared atezolizumab plus 
carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel versus chemotherapy alone as first-line 
therapy in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC with no EGFR 
mutations or ALK fusions.857 Median overall survival was 18.6 months 
(95% CI, 16.0–21.2) in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy arm versus 
13.9 months (95% CI, 12.0–18.7) with carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel (HR, 
0.79; 95% CI, 0.64–0.98; P = .033). Treatment-related deaths were 
reported in 2% (8/473) of patients in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy 
arm and in less than 1% (1/232) of patients in the chemotherapy only arm.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends the ABCP regimen (category 1; 
other recommended intervention) as a first-line therapy option for eligible 
patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC (including 
adenocarcinoma) based on clinical trial data and FDA approval.855 The 
ABCP regimen (also known as the quadruplicate regimen) is 
recommended as a first-line therapy option for patients with negative test 
results for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, METex14 skipping, RET, or BRAF variants, 
regardless of PD-L1 expression levels. Maintenance therapy with 
atezolizumab and bevacizumab is also recommended in this setting 
(category 1; other recommended intervention) (see Maintenance Therapy 
in this Discussion). For the 2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC 
Panel preference stratified the systemic therapy regimens and decided 
that the ABCP regimen is an other recommended intervention, because 
the NCCN NSCLC Panel prefers the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
regimens based on tolerability and experience with these regimens. The 
NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends that bevacizumab biosimilars may be

used in any of the systemic therapy regimens containing bevacizumab, 
such as ABCP, that are used for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC 
based on clinical data and FDA approvals.753-757  
For the 2020 update (Version 2), the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
atezolizumab/carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel (category 2A; other recommended 
intervention) as a first-line therapy option for eligible patients with 
metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial data.857 
Atezolizumab/carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel is recommended as a first-line 
therapy option for patients with metastatic NSCLC and negative test 
results for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, METex14 skipping, RET, or BRAF variants, 
regardless of histology or PD-L1 levels. Maintenance therapy with 
atezolizumab is also recommended in this setting (category 2A).  
IMpower110, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared first-line therapy with 
atezolizumab monotherapy versus platinum-based chemotherapy in three 
different subgroups of patients with metastatic NSCLC, including those 
with high PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 stained ≥ 50% of tumor cells [TC ≥ 
50%] or PD-L1 stained tumor-infiltrating [IC] covering ≥ 10% of the tumor 
area [IC ≥ 10%]); patients were wild type for EGFR or ALK variants and 
most were either former smokers or current smokers.858 Patients receiving 
first-line atezolizumab monotherapy also received maintenance therapy 
with atezolizumab. Chemotherapy regimens for patients with 
nonsquamous NSCLC included cisplatin (or carboplatin)/pemetrexed and 
maintenance therapy with pemetrexed; patients with squamous cell 
NSCLC received cisplatin/gemcitabine and best supportive care as 
maintenance therapy.  
It is important to note that a different IHC assay was used to test for PD-L1 
levels in IMpower110 (SP142 PD-L1 IHC assay) compared with IHC 
assays used for pembrolizumab monotherapy in KEYNOTE-024 (PD-L1 
IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay); however, the results were similar regardless 
of which PD-L1 IHC assay was used.859 Data suggest that different 
methods of testing for PD-L1 levels are not equivalent.318,319 Based on an 
interim analysis using the SP142 PD-L1 IHC assay, median OS was 20.2 
months (95% CI,16.5–not estimable) with atezolizumab monotherapy (n = 
107) versus 13.1 months (95% CI, 7.4–16.5 months) with chemotherapy 
(n = 98) (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40–0.89; P=.0106) in patients with high 
PD-L1 expression. Based on an interim analysis using the 22C3 pharmDx 
assay, median OS was 20.2 months with atezolizumab monotherapy (n = 
134) versus 11.0 months with chemotherapy (n = 126) (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 
0.41–0.86).859 There was no survival advantage in the other two 
subgroups of patients with lower PD-L1 expression (ie, TC ≥ 5% or IC ≥ 
5%; TC ≥ 1% or IC ≥ 1%). Atezolizumab monotherapy was associated 
with fatal adverse reactions in 3.8% of all patients (11/ 286, all 3 groups) 
including aspiration, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary 
embolism, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, mechanical ileus, 
sepsis, cerebral infraction, and device occlusion; 4.2% of patients (11/263) 
receiving chemotherapy also died. Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse 
events occurred in 12.9% of patients receiving atezolizumab monotherapy 
versus 44.1% with chemotherapy. The most frequent serious adverse 
reactions with atezolizumab monotherapy were pneumonia (2.8%), 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2.1%), and pneumonitis (2.1%); 
28% of patients had serious adverse reactions.  
For the 2020 update (Version 5), the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
atezolizumab monotherapy (category 2A; preferred) as a first-line therapy 
option for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based on preliminary 
clinical trial data and on the FDA approval.858 Atezolizumab monotherapy 
is recommended as a first-line therapy option for patients with metastatic 
NSCLC, PD-L1 levels of 50% or more, and negative test results for EGFR, 
ALK, ROS1, METex14 skipping, RET, or BRAF variants, regardless of 
histology; maintenance therapy with atezolizumab is also recommended in 
this setting. For the Version 5 update, the NCCN NSCLC Panel preference

preferred recommended option in this setting based on clinical trial data.858  
Subsequent Therapy 
OAK, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared atezolizumab versus 
docetaxel in patients with metastatic NSCLC who had progressed during 
or after systemic therapy.839,860 Most patients were current or former 
smokers and had received platinum-based chemotherapy; 10% of 
patients were not reported because they had EGFR mutations and ALK 
fusions.839,860 Patients with nonsquamous NSCLC who received 
atezolizumab had longer overall survival (15.6 months; 95% CI, 13.3–
17.6) when compared with those receiving docetaxel (11.2 months; 95% 
CI, 9.3–12.6; HR, 0.73; 0.6–0.89; P = .0015). In patients with squamous 
cell NSCLC, overall survival was 8.9 months (95% CI, 7.4–12.8) in 
patients receiving atezolizumab versus 7.7 months (95% CI, 6.3–8.9) 
with docetaxel (HR, 0.73; 0.54–0.98; P = .038). Fewer patients were in 
the squamous group compared with the nonsquamous group (222 vs. 
628). Fewer treatment-related severe adverse events (grades 3–4) were 
reported for atezolizumab versus docetaxel (15% vs. 43% [90/609 vs. 
247/578]).  
If patients have not previously received a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, the NCCN 
NSCLC Panel recommends atezolizumab (category 1; preferred) as a 
subsequent therapy option for patients with metastatic nonsquamous or 
squamous cell NSCLC based on clinical trial data and FDA 
approval.314,839,860 Testing for PD-L1 expression levels is not required for 
prescribing atezolizumab but may provide useful information.  
Nivolumab with or Without Ipilimumab 
Nivolumab and ipilimumab are ICIs that have complementary mechanisms 
of action on T-cells; nivolumab is used either with or without ipilimumab. 
Nivolumab inhibits PD-1 receptors, which improves antitumor 
immunity.309,312,121 PD-1 receptors are expressed on activated cytotoxic T 
cells.309-311 Ipilimumab is a human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 
(CTLA-4)–blocking antibody that binds to CTLA-4 and prevents the 
interactions with CD80/CD86, which induces de novo T-cell responses 
against tumors; CTLA-4 inhibits T-cell activation.861 Immune-mediated 
adverse events may occur with nivolumab or nivolumab/ipilimumab.862 For 
patients with immune-mediated adverse events, intravenous high-dose 
corticosteroids should be administered based on the severity of the 
reaction (see the NCCN Guidelines for the Management of 
Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities, available at www.NCCN.org). 
Nivolumab either with or without ipilimumab should also be permanently 
discontinued for patients with severe or life-threatening pneumonitis and 
should be discontinued for other severe or life-threatening 
immune-mediated adverse events when indicated (see prescribing 
information). If patients are receiving nivolumab plus ipilimumab and have 
treatment-related adverse events, it may be reasonable to discontinue 
ipilimumab and continue the nivolumab.862  
First-Line Therapy 
CheckMate 227, a phase 3 randomized trial in patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC who had PS 0 to 1 and no EGFR 
mutations or ALK fusions, compared nivolumab/ipilimumab, nivolumab 
monotherapy, and chemotherapy for patients with PD-L1 expression levels 
of 1% or more. Nivolumab/ipilimumab, nivolumab/chemotherapy, and 
chemotherapy alone were also compared for patients with PD-L1 
expression levels less than 1%. In addition, first-line nivolumab/ipilimumab 
and chemotherapy were compared as one of the co-primary analyses in 
the patients who had high TMB levels (≥10 mutations/megabase).179 The 
PFS rate at 1 year was 42.6% for nivolumab/ipilimumab versus 13.2% for

months (95% CI, 5.5–13.2) compared with 5.5 months for chemotherapy 
alone (95% CI, 4.4–5.8) (HR for disease progression or death, 0.58;

97.5% CI, 0.41–0.81; P < .001). The objective response rate for 
nivolumab/ipilimumab was 45.3% versus 26.9% with chemotherapy alone; 
nivolumab/ipilimumab was beneficial regardless of PD-L1 expression 
levels or histology. The rate of grade 3 or 4 adverse events was similar for 
nivolumab/ipilimumab versus chemotherapy alone (31% vs. 36%). The 
median PFS was not significantly different when comparing nivolumab 
monotherapy (N = 71) (4.2 months; 95% CI, 2.7–8.3) versus 
chemotherapy (N = 79) (5.6 months; 95% CI, 4.5–7.0). Updated results 
from CheckMate 227 for patients with PD-L1 expression of 1% or more, 
reported that the median overall survival was 17.1 months (95% CI, 15.0–
20.1) for nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 14.9 months (95% CI, 12.7–
16.7) for chemotherapy (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65–0.96; P = .007).862  
For the 2020 update (Version 2), the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab (category 2A) as a first-line therapy option for 
eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial 
data.179,180,862 Nivolumab/ipilimumab is recommended for patients with 
metastatic NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 levels or histology; negative test 
results for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, METex14 skipping, RET, or BRAF variants; 
and no contraindications to immunotherapy. For the 2020 update (Version 
1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel preference stratified the systemic therapy 
regimens and decided that first-line therapy with nivolumab/ipilimumab is 
“useful in certain circumstances” (eg, renal impairment) for patients with 
PD-L1 levels of 1% or more and is an “other recommended” first-line 
therapy option for patients with PD-L1 levels less than 1%.TMB is 
considered to be an emerging biomarker that may be useful in selecting 
patients for nivolumab with or without ipilimumab; however, there is no 
consensus on how to measure TMB.  
CheckMate 9LA, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared first-line 
nivolumab/ipilimumab and 2 cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy 
versus 4 cycles of chemotherapy alone in patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 expression 
levels, who had PS 0 to 1 and no EGFR mutations or ALK fusions.863 For 
metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, the chemotherapy was pemetrexed with 
either cisplatin or carboplatin; for metastatic squamous NSCLC, the 
chemotherapy was paclitaxel with carboplatin. Preliminary data show that 
the median overall survival with nivolumab/ipilimumab/chemotherapy was 
15.6 months (95% CI, 13.9–20.0 months) versus 10.9 months (95% CI, 
9.5–12.5 months) with chemotherapy regardless of histology or PD-L1 
expression levels (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55–0.80). Overall survival was also 
significantly different between the groups based on histology or PD-L1 
expression levels. The overall response rate was 38% with nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab plus chemotherapy versus 25% with chemotherapy alone. 
Serious grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 25.4% of patients 
receiving nivolumab/ipilimumab/chemotherapy versus 15% in those 
receiving chemotherapy alone. The death rate was 2% in each arm 
(nivolumab/ipilimumab/chemotherapy: 7/358; chemotherapy alone: 6/349). 
In the nivolumab/ipilimumab/chemotherapy arm, treatment-related deaths 
were from acute renal failure due to chemotherapy, thrombocytopenia, 
pneumonitis, hepatic toxicity, hepatitis, diarrhea, sepsis, and acute renal 
insufficiency; treatment-related deaths in the chemotherapy arm were from 
anemia, pancytopenia, febrile neutropenia, respiratory failure, pulmonary 
sepsis, and sepsis. The most common treatment-related adverse events 
(≥15%) were nausea, anemia, asthenia, and diarrhea. 
For the 2020 update (Version 6), the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
nivolumab/ipilimumab/chemotherapy (category 2A; other recommended) 
as a first-line therapy option for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC 
based on preliminary clinical trial data and the FDA approval.863 For 
metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, the recommended chemotherapy is 
pemetrexed with either cisplatin or carboplatin; for metastatic squamous 
NSCLC, the recommended chemotherapy is paclitaxel with carboplatin.

metastatic NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 levels; negative test results for 
EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, METex14 skipping, or RET variants; and no 
contraindications to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. For the Version 6 update, the 
panel preference stratified the regimen and voted that first-line therapy 
with nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus chemotherapy is an “other 
recommended” first-line therapy option for eligible patients with metastatic 
NSCLC.  
Subsequent Therapy 
CheckMate-057, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared nivolumab versus 
docetaxel as subsequent therapy for patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous NSCLC who had progressed on or after first-line 
chemotherapy.309 Median overall survival was 12.2 months (95% CI, 9.7–
15.0) for patients receiving nivolumab compared with 9.4 months (95% CI, 
8.1–10.7) for docetaxel (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59–0.89; P = .002).309 The 
median duration of response was 17.2 months with nivolumab compared 
with 5.6 months for docetaxel. At 18 months, the overall survival rate was 
39% (95% CI, 34%–45%) with nivolumab compared with 23% (95% CI, 
19%–28%) with docetaxel. Fewer grade 3 to 5 adverse events were 
reported for nivolumab (10%) when compared with docetaxel (54%). 
Although many patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC benefit 
from nivolumab, those whose tumors have PD-L1 staining of 1% to 10% or 
more have an overall survival of 17 to 19 months compared with 8 to 9 
months for docetaxel. For patients who did not have PD-L1 expression, 
there was no difference in overall survival for nivolumab versus docetaxel; 
however, nivolumab was associated with a longer duration of response 
and fewer side effects. 
CheckMate-017, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared nivolumab versus 
docetaxel as subsequent therapy for patients with metastatic squamous 
cell NSCLC who had progressed on or after first-line chemotherapy.312 
Median overall survival was 9.2 months (95% CI, 7.3–13.3) with nivolumab 
compared with 6.0 months (95% CI, 5.1–7.3) for docetaxel (HR, 0.59; 95% 
CI, 0.44–0.79; P < .001).312 Patients had a response rate of 20% with 
nivolumab compared with 9% for docetaxel (P = .008). PD-L1 expression 
was not associated with response to nivolumab in patients with squamous 
cell NSCLC. Fewer grade 3 to 4 adverse events were reported with 
nivolumab (7%) compared with docetaxel (55%). No patients died in the 
nivolumab arm versus 3 deaths in the docetaxel arm. 
In a long-term analysis of CheckMate-057 and CheckMate-017, 2-year 
survival and durable responses were increased in patients with advanced 
NSCLC receiving nivolumab when compared with docetaxel.864 For 
patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, 2-year survival was 29% (95% CI, 
24%–34%) with nivolumab versus 16% (95% CI, 12%–20%) with 
docetaxel. For those with squamous NSCLC, 2-year survival was 23% 
(95% CI, 16%–30%) with nivolumab versus 8% (95% CI, 4%–13%) with 
docetaxel. Fewer severe treatment-related adverse events were reported 
with nivolumab compared with docetaxel (grade 3–4, 10% vs. 55%).  
If patients have not previously received a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, the NCCN 
NSCLC Panel recommends single-agent nivolumab (category 1; 
preferred) as a subsequent therapy option for patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC who have progressed on or after 
first-line chemotherapy based on clinical trial data and the FDA 
approvals.309,312,864,865 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends nivolumab, 
atezolizumab, or pembrolizumab as preferred subsequent therapy options 
(category 1 for all) based on improved overall survival rates, longer 
duration of response, and fewer adverse events when compared with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy.309,312,840,866  
To help clinicians determine which patients with nonsquamous NSCLC 
may benefit most from treatment with nivolumab, the FDA has approved a 
complementary diagnostic biomarker test to assess for PD-L1 protein 
expression.867 Testing for PD-L1 is not required for prescribing nivolumab

but may provide useful information.320 Current or former smoking status 
correlated with the response rate to ICIs.309,868 Data suggest that 
mismatch repair deficiency is associated with response to ICIs.869,870  
Immune-related adverse events, such as pneumonitis, may occur with 
nivolumab.311,844,846,871-875 Intravenous high-dose corticosteroids should be 
administered for patients with immune-mediated adverse events based on 
the severity of the reaction (see the NCCN Guidelines for the Management 
of Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities, available at www.NCCN.org). 
Nivolumab should be discontinued for patients with severe or 
life-threatening pneumonitis and should be withheld or discontinued for 
other severe or life-threatening immune-mediated adverse events when 
indicated (see prescribing information). 
Maintenance Therapy  
Maintenance therapy refers to systemic therapy that may be given for 
patients with advanced NSCLC after 4 to 6 cycles of first-line therapy.876 
Patients are only candidates for maintenance therapy if their tumors have 
responded to their previous treatment (ie, tumor response) or they have 
stable disease and their tumors have not progressed. Continuation 
maintenance therapy refers to the use of at least one of the agents that 
was given in the first-line regimen. Switch maintenance therapy refers to 
the initiation of a different agent that was not included as part of the 
first-line regimen. Selection of appropriate maintenance therapy depends 
on several factors (eg, histologic type, presence of mutations or gene 
fusions, PS). Maintenance therapy is recommended in the NCCN 
Guidelines for select patients with tumor response or stable disease and is 
not recommended for all patients (eg, not recommended for PS 3–4, those 
with progression) (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).877 For the 2020 
update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel deleted the recommendation for 
close observation instead of maintenance therapy.  
Continuation Maintenance Therapy 
For continuation maintenance therapy, select agents (which were initially 
given with first-line therapy) may be continued until evidence of disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity based on the design of the clinical 
trials that led to their approval. This section mainly discusses continuation 
maintenance with chemotherapy; continuation maintenance with ICIs is 
discussed in another section (see Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in this 
Discussion). Single-agent bevacizumab (category 1) may be continued 
beyond 4 to 6 cycles of initial therapy (ie, platinum-doublet chemotherapy 
given with bevacizumab) in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC.720,878,879 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends that bevacizumab biosimilars 
may be used in any of the systemic therapy regimens containing 
bevacizumab (eg, carboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab) that are used for 
eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based on clinical data and FDA 
approvals.753-757 Therefore, if a bevacizumab biosimilar was initially used 
as part of first-line combination therapy, the biosimilar should be 
continued as maintenance therapy in eligible patients.  
PARAMOUNT, a phase 3 randomized trial, reported that continuation 
maintenance therapy with pemetrexed slightly increased PFS when 
compared with placebo (4.1 vs. 2.8 months).880 Updated results from 
PARAMOUNT reported that continuation maintenance therapy with 
pemetrexed also improves overall survival (13.9 vs. 11.0 months).881 The 
NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends single-agent pemetrexed as 
continuation maintenance therapy (category 1) in patients with 
nonsquamous NSCLC based on clinical trial data and FDA 
approval.878,880,881  
POINTBREAK, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed bevacizumab plus 
carboplatin/pemetrexed or bevacizumab plus carboplatin/paclitaxel in 
patients with metastatic NSCLC; patients received maintenance therapy 
with either bevacizumab/pemetrexed or bevacizumab alone.726 PFS was 6

months with pemetrexed plus carboplatin/bevacizumab versus 5.6 months 
with paclitaxel plus carboplatin/bevacizumab.726 It is important to note that 
the pemetrexed-based arm was associated with less toxicity (eg, less 
neurotoxicity, less neutropenia, less hair loss) than the paclitaxel-based 
arm.  
AVAPERL, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed maintenance therapy 
with bevacizumab/pemetrexed versus bevacizumab alone in patients with 
advanced nonsquamous NSCLC; the initial regimen was 
bevacizumab/cisplatin/pemetrexed.882,883 An updated analysis reported 
that overall survival was 17.1 months with bevacizumab/pemetrexed 
maintenance versus 13.2 months with bevacizumab alone (HR, 0.87; 95% 
CI, 0.63–1.21; P = .29).882 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
continuation maintenance therapy with bevacizumab/pemetrexed 
(category 2A) in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC who initially received 
bevacizumab/pemetrexed/platinum regimen based on clinical trial 
data.882,883  
IFCT-GFPC 0502, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared using 
maintenance therapy with either gemcitabine or erlotinib after first-line 
therapy with cisplatin-gemcitabine in patients with advanced NSCLC. 
Continuation maintenance therapy with single-agent gemcitabine was 
reported to increase PFS to a greater extent (3.8 months) than switch 
maintenance therapy with erlotinib (2.9 months) when compared with 
observation (1.9 months).672,884 A phase 3 randomized trial from the 
CECOG assessed continuation maintenance therapy with gemcitabine 
versus best supportive care after an initial regimen of 
cisplatin/gemcitabine.885 The data showed a slight difference in PFS but no 
difference in overall survival (13 vs. 11 months, respectively; P = .195). 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends gemcitabine (category 2B) as 
continuation maintenance therapy regardless of histology in patients with 
metastatic NSCLC, negative test results for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, METex14 
skipping, RET, or BRAF variants, and PD-L1 expression less than 1%.  
Use of continuation maintenance therapy depends on several factors, 
such as whether the patient had minimal toxicity during treatment. A drug 
vacation may be more appropriate for some patients.724 Some clinicians 
feel that continuation maintenance therapy is only appropriate for select 
patients, because it has only been shown to improve overall survival or 
quality of life for a few agents and not all agents, although it has been 
shown to improve PFS.722,724 In addition, maintenance therapy has not 
been shown to be superior to subsequent therapy, which is initiated at 
disease progression. A phase 3 randomized trial suggests that 
conventional cytotoxic agents should not be continued beyond 4 to 6 
cycles of therapy; however, many patients assigned to a longer duration of 
therapy did not receive the planned number of cycles (see Maintenance 
Therapy in this Discussion).721,722  
Switch Maintenance Therapy 
Issues have been raised about switch maintenance therapy, including the 
design of the trials, modest survival benefits, quality of life, and 
toxicity.724,886 Two phase 3 randomized trials reported a benefit in PFS and 
overall survival with the initiation of pemetrexed after first-line 
chemotherapy (4–6 cycles) in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC and no 
apparent disease progression.887,888 The NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends switch maintenance therapy with pemetrexed in patients with 
nonsquamous cell carcinoma; negative test results for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, 
METex14 skipping, RET, or BRAF variants; and PD-L1 expression less 
than 1% based on clinical trial data and FDA approval.888,889  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel does not recommend erlotinib as switch 
maintenance therapy (or as subsequent therapy) for patients with 
nonsquamous NSCLC, good PS, negative test results for EGFR, ALK, 
ROS1, METex14 skipping, RET, or BRAF variants based on results from

IUNO, a randomized trial, and a revised indication from the FDA.890 The 
NCCN NSCLC Panel also deleted the recommendations for switch 
maintenance therapy with erlotinib in patients with squamous cell NSCLC, 
because overall survival and quality of life were not improved.672,891 A 
phase 3 trial assessed switch maintenance therapy with docetaxel given 
either immediately after chemotherapy or delayed until progression.892 
Switch maintenance therapy with docetaxel is a category 2B 
recommendation in the NCCN Guidelines for patients with squamous cell 
NSCLC, good PS, and negative test results for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, 
METex14 skipping, RET, or BRAF variants, because many patients in the 
delayed chemotherapy arm did not receive docetaxel.892  
Clinical Evaluation  
The workup and evaluation of incidental lung nodules that are detected on 
imaging for other conditions are described in the NSCLC algorithm (see 
Incidental Lung Nodules in this Discussion and the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). The cutoff thresholds are 6 mm for a positive scan result for 
incidental solid and subsolid lung nodules detected on chest CT based on 
the Fleischner criteria (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).79-83 As 
previously described, low-dose CT screening is recommended for 
asymptomatic select patients who are at high risk for lung cancer and 
management of any nodules detected in these patients is described 
elsewhere (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening, 
available at www.NCCN.org).  
After patients are confirmed to have NSCLC based on a pathologic 
diagnosis, a clinical evaluation needs to be done (see the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). In patients with symptoms, the clinical stage is 
initially determined from disease history (ie, cough, dyspnea, chest pain, 
weight loss) and physical examination together with a limited battery of 
tests (see Evaluation and Clinical Stage in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). The NCCN NSCLC Panel also recommends that smoking 
cessation advice, counseling, and pharmacotherapy be provided to 
patients.42,893-895 After the clinical stage is determined, the patient is 
assigned to one of the pathways that are defined by the stage, specific 
subdivision of the particular stage, and location of the tumor. Note that for 
some patients, diagnosis, staging, and surgical resection are done during 
the same operative procedure. A multidisciplinary evaluation should be 
done before treatment.  
Additional Pretreatment Evaluation 
As previously noted, evaluation of the mediastinal nodes is a key step in 
the further staging of the patient. FDG PET/CT scans can be used as an 
initial assessment of the hilar and mediastinal nodes (ie, to determine 
whether the N1, N2, or N3 nodes are positive for cancer, which is a key 
determinant of stage II and stage III disease); however, CT scans have 
known limitations for evaluating the extent of lymph node involvement in 
lung cancer.96,896-898 When compared with noninvasive staging methods 
(EBUS, EUS), surgical staging with mediastinoscopy is more appropriate 
for certain settings when evaluating mediastinal nodes; however, 
clinicians use both methods when staging patients.96 Thus, 
mediastinoscopy is encouraged as part of the initial evaluation, particularly 
if the results of imaging are not conclusive and the probability of 
mediastinal involvement is high (based on tumor size and location). 
Therefore, mediastinoscopy is appropriate for patients with T2 to T3 
lesions even if the FDG PET/CT scan does not suggest mediastinal node 
involvement.  
Mediastinoscopy may also be appropriate to confirm mediastinal node 
involvement in patients with a positive FDG PET/CT scan. In patients with 
solid tumors less than 1 cm or those with purely nonsolid tumors (ie, 
GGOs) less than 3 cm, pathologic mediastinal lymph node evaluation is 
optional if the nodes are FDG PET/CT negative because there is a low 
likelihood of positive mediastinal nodes.899 Mediastinal evaluation can be

MS-68 
considered in patients with clinical stage 1A disease (T1ab,N0). In patients 
with peripheral T2a, central T1ab, or T2a lesions with negative FDG 
PET/CT scans, the risk for mediastinal lymph node involvement is higher 
and mediastinoscopy and/or EUS-FNA and EBUS-TBNA are 
recommended. Dillemans et al have reported a selective mediastinoscopy 
strategy, proceeding straight to thoracotomy without mediastinoscopy for 
T1 peripheral tumors without enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes on 
preoperative CT.900 This strategy resulted in a 16% incidence of positive 
N2 nodes discovered only at the time of thoracotomy.  
For identifying N2 disease, chest CT scans had sensitivity and specificity 
rates of 69% and 71%, respectively. Using the chest CT scan plus 
mediastinoscopy was significantly more accurate (89% vs. 71%) than 
using the chest CT scan alone for identifying N2 disease. When using CT 
scans, node positivity is based on the size of the lymph nodes. Therefore, 
the CT scan will miss small metastases that do not result in node 
enlargement. To address this issue, Arita et al specifically examined lung 
cancer metastases to normal size mediastinal lymph nodes in 90 patients 
and found an incidence of 16% (14/90) false-negative chest CT scans with 
histologic identification of occult N2 or N3 disease.901 Bronchoscopy is 
used in diagnosis and local staging of both central and peripheral lung 
lesions and is recommended for pretreatment evaluation of stage I to IIIA 
tumors. In patients who present with a solitary pulmonary nodule where 
the suspicion of malignancy is high, surgical resection without prior 
invasive testing may be reasonable.  
As previously mentioned, CT scans have known limitations for evaluating 
the extent of lymph node involvement in lung cancer.896 PET scans have 
been used to help evaluate the extent of disease and to provide more 
accurate staging. The NCCN NSCLC Panel reviewed the diagnostic 
performance of CT and PET scans. The NCCN NSCLC Panel believes 
that PET scans can play a role in the evaluation and more accurate 
staging of NSCLC, for example, in identifying stage I (peripheral and 
central T1–2,N0), stage II, stage III, and stage IV diseases.96,902,903 
However, FDG PET/CT is even more sensitive and is recommended by 
NCCN.904-906 PET/CT is typically done from the skull base to the knees; 
whole body PET/CT may also be done.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel assessed studies that examined the sensitivity 
and specificity of chest CT scans for mediastinal lymph node staging.907 
Depending on the clinical scenario, a sensitivity of 40% to 65% and a 
specificity of 45% to 90% were reported.908 Because they detect tumor 
physiology, as opposed to anatomy, PET scans may be more sensitive 
than CT scans. Moreover, if postobstructive pneumonitis is present, there 
is little correlation between the size of the mediastinal lymph nodes and 
tumor involvement.909 Chin et al found that PET, when used to stage the 
mediastinal nodes, was 78% sensitive and 81% specific with a negative 
predictive value of 89%.910 Kernstine et al compared PET scan to CT scan 
for identifying N2 and N3 disease in NSCLC.911 The PET scan was found 
to be more sensitive than the CT scan in identifying mediastinal node 
disease (70% vs. 65%). FDG PET/CT has been shown to be useful in 
restaging patients after adjuvant therapy.912,913  
When patients with early-stage disease are accurately staged using FDG 
PET/CT, inappropriate surgery is avoided.904 Positive FDG PET/CT scan 
findings for distant disease need pathologic or other radiologic 
confirmation (eg, MRI of bone). If the FDG PET/CT scan is positive in the 
mediastinum, the lymph node status needs pathologic confirmation.96,914 
Transesophageal EUS-FNA and EBUS-TBNA have proven useful to stage 
patients or to diagnose mediastinal lesions; these techniques can be used 
instead of invasive staging procedures in select patients.915-918 When 
compared with CT and PET, EBUS-TBNA has a high sensitivity and 
specificity for staging mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes in patients with 
lung cancer.919 In patients with positive nodes on CT or PET, EBUS-TNBA

can be used to clarify the results.920,921 In patients with negative findings on 
EBUS-TNBA, conventional mediastinoscopy can be done to confirm the 
results.916,921-923 Note that EBUS is also known as endosonography.  
The routine use of bone scans (to exclude bone metastases) is not 
recommended. Brain MRI with contrast is recommended to rule out 
asymptomatic brain metastases in patients with stage II, III, and IV 
disease if aggressive combined-modality therapy is being considered.924 
Patients with stage IB NSCLC are less likely to have brain metastases; 
therefore, brain MRI is optional in this setting and can be considered for 
select patients at high risk (eg, tumors greater than 5 cm, central location). 
If brain MRI cannot be done, then CT of the head with contrast is an 
option. Note that PET scans are not recommended for assessing whether 
brain metastases are present (see the NCCN Guidelines for Central 
Nervous System Cancers, available at www.NCCN.org).  
Initial Therapy 
As previously mentioned, accurate pathologic assessment and staging are 
essential before treatment for NSCLC, because management varies 
depending on the stage, histology, presence of genetic variants, and PS. 
Before treatment, it is strongly recommended that determination of tumor 
resectability be made by thoracic surgeons who perform lung cancer 
surgery as a prominent part of their practice (see Principles of Surgical 
Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). RT doses are also 
recommended in the algorithm (see Principles of Radiation Therapy in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). In addition, the NCCN Guidelines also 
recommend regimens for targeted therapy, immunotherapy, 
chemotherapy, and chemoradiation (see Chemotherapy Regimens for 
Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Therapy, Chemotherapy Regimens Used with 
Radiation Therapy, and Systemic Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic 
Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Targeted therapy is 
recommended for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC and positive 
test results for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, METex14 skipping, RET, or 
NTRK variants.  
Stage I, Stage II, and Stage IIIA Disease 
Depending on the extent and type of comorbidity present, patients with 
stage I or a subset of stage II (T1–2,N1) tumors are generally candidates 
for surgical resection and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Definitive 
RT, including SABR, is recommended for patients with early-stage NSCLC 
who are medically inoperable or refuse surgery; RT can be considered as 
an alternative to surgery in patients at high risk of complications (see 
Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy in this Discussion and see Initial 
Treatment for Stage I and II in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).326,344,347,420,477,925 In some instances, positive mediastinal nodes 
(N2) are discovered at surgery; in this setting, an additional assessment of 
staging and tumor resectability must be made, and the treatment (ie, 
inclusion of systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection) must be 
modified accordingly. Therefore, the NCCN Guidelines include 2 different 
tracks for T1–2,N2 disease (ie, stage IIIA disease): 1) T1–2,N2 disease 
discovered unexpectedly at surgical exploration; and 2) T1–2,N2 disease 
confirmed before thoracotomy. In the second case, an initial brain MRI 
with contrast and FDG PET/CT scan (if not previously done) are 
recommended to rule out metastatic disease.  
For patients with clinical stage IIB (T3,N0) and stage IIIA tumors who have 
different treatment options (surgery, RT, or chemotherapy), a 
multidisciplinary evaluation is recommended before treatment. For the 
subsets of stage IIB (T3,N0) and stage IIIA (T4,N0–1) tumors, treatment 
options are organized according to the location of the tumor such as the 
superior sulcus, chest wall, proximal airway, or mediastinum.334 For each 
location, a thoracic surgeon needs to determine whether the tumor is 
resectable (see Principles of Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
 
MS-70 
For patients with resectable tumors (T3 invasion,N0–1) in the superior 
sulcus, the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends preoperative concurrent 
chemoradiation therapy followed by surgical resection and chemotherapy 
(see Initial Treatment for Superior Sulcus Tumors in the NCCN Guidelines 
for NSCLC). Preoperative concurrent chemoradiation followed by surgical 
resection of a superior sulcus tumor has shown 2-year survival in the 50% 
to 70% range.334,440,442,926-929 The overall 5-year survival rate is 
approximately 40%.440,930 Patients with possibly resectable superior sulcus 
tumors should undergo preoperative concurrent chemoradiation before 
surgical re-evaluation (including CT ± PET/CT). For patients with 
unresectable tumors (T4 extension,N0–1) in the superior sulcus, definitive 
concurrent chemoradiation is recommended. Two additional cycles of 
full-dose chemotherapy can be given if full-dose chemotherapy was not 
given concurrently with RT.694,931 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
durvalumab (category 1) as consolidation immunotherapy after treatment 
with definitive concurrent chemoradiation for eligible patients with 
unresectable stage III NSCLC based on data from a phase 3 randomized 
trial and FDA approval (see Chemoradiation: Trial Data and Durvalumab 
in this Discussion and the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).313 The 
recommendation for consolidation immunotherapy with durvalumab occurs 
in multiple places in the NCCN Guidelines.  
Surgical resection is the preferred treatment option for patients with 
tumors of the chest wall, proximal airway, or mediastinum (T3–4,N0–1). 
Other treatment options include preoperative chemotherapy or concurrent 
chemoradiation before surgical resection. For unresectable tumors 
(T4,N0–1) without pleural effusion, definitive concurrent chemoradiation 
(category 1) is recommended followed by consolidation immunotherapy 
with durvalumab (category 1).386,634 Recently, the NCCN NSCLC Panel 
deleted the recommendation to add an additional 2 cycles of full-dose 
chemotherapy if patients have not received full-dose chemotherapy 
concurrently with RT and will be receiving durvalumab, based on 
concerns that consolidation chemotherapy will increase the risk of 
pneumonitis if patients are also receiving durvalumab. However, 
consolidation chemotherapy is an option if patients will not be receiving 
durvalumab.  
Multimodality therapy is recommended for most patients with stage III 
NSCLC.686 For patients with stage IIIA disease and positive mediastinal 
nodes (T1–2,N2), treatment is based on the findings of pathologic 
mediastinal lymph node evaluation (see the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). Patients with negative mediastinal biopsy findings are 
candidates for surgery. For those patients with resectable lesions, 
mediastinal lymph node dissection or lymph node sampling should be 
performed during the operation. Those individuals who are medically 
inoperable should be treated according to their clinical stage (see the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). For patients with (T1–2) N2 node-positive 
disease, a brain MRI with contrast and FDG PET/CT scan (if not done 
previously) are recommended to search for distant metastases. When 
distant metastases are not present, the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
that the patient be treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiation 
therapy (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).419,635 Recommended 
therapy for metastatic disease depends on whether disease is in a solitary 
site or is widespread (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).  
When a lung metastasis is present, it usually occurs in a patient with other 
systemic metastases; the prognosis is poor. Therefore, many of these 
patients are not candidates for surgery; however, systemic therapy is 
recommended. Although uncommon, patients with lung metastases but 
without systemic metastases have a better prognosis and are candidates 
for surgery (see Multiple Lung Cancers in this Discussion).932 Patients with 
separate pulmonary nodule(s) in the same lobe (T3,N0–1) or ipsilateral 
non-primary lobe (T4,N0–1) without other systemic metastases are 
potentially curable by surgery; 5-year survival rates are about 30%.933 For

MS-71 
those with N2 nodes after surgery, concurrent chemoradiation is 
recommended for those with positive margins and an R2 resection; either 
sequential or concurrent chemoradiation is recommended after an R1 
resection. Most NCCN Member Institutions favor concurrent 
chemoradiation for positive margins, but sequential chemoradiation is 
reasonable in frailer patients.689 For those with N2 nodes and negative 
margins, sequential chemotherapy (category 1) with RT is recommended. 
Chemotherapy alone is recommended for those with N0–1 nodes (see the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). In patients with synchronous solitary 
nodules (contralateral lung), the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
treating them as 2 primary lung tumors if both are curable, even if the 
histology of the 2 tumors is similar (see the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).934  
Multiple Lung Cancers  
Patients with a history of lung cancer or those with biopsy-proven 
synchronous lesions may be suspected of having multiple lung cancers 
(see Clinical Presentation in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).935,936 It is 
important to determine whether the multiple lung cancers are metastases 
or separate lung primaries (synchronous or metachronous); most multiple 
lung tumors are metastases.74,334,937,938 Therefore, it is essential to 
determine the histology of the lung tumor (see Principles of Pathologic 
Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Infection and other benign 
diseases also need to be ruled out (eg, inflammatory granulomas).939,940 
Although criteria have been established for diagnosing multiple lung 
cancers, no definitive method has been established before treatment.940-943 
The Martini and Melamed criteria are often used to diagnose multiple lung 
cancers as follows: 1) the histologies are different; or 2) the histologies are 
the same, but there is no lymph node involvement and no extrathoracic 
metastases.943  
Treatment of multiple lung cancers depends on the status of the lymph 
nodes (eg, N0–1) and on whether patients are asymptomatic, 
symptomatic, or at high or low risk of becoming symptomatic (see Multiple 
Lung Cancers in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).937,944-946 Patients 
should be evaluated in a multidisciplinary setting by surgeons, radiation 
oncologists, and medical oncologists. In patients eligible for definitive local 
therapy, parenchymal-sparing resection is preferred (see the Principles of 
Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).936,937 VATS or 
SABR are reasonable options depending on the number and distribution of 
the tumors requiring local treatment.947 Multiple lung nodules (eg, solid, 
subsolid nodules) may also be detected on CT scans; some of these 
nodules can be followed with imaging, whereas others need to be biopsied 
or excised (see Incidental Lung Nodules in this Discussion and the NCCN 
Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening, available at www.NCCN.org).948  
Stage IIIB and IIIC NSCLC  
Stage IIIB NSCLC comprises 2 unresectable groups, including: 1) T1–
2,N3 tumors; and 2) T3–4,N2 tumors; stage IIIC NSCLC includes 
contralateral mediastinal nodes (T4,N3), which are also unresectable. 
Surgical resection is not recommended in patients with T1–2,N3 disease. 
However, in patients with suspected N3 disease, the NCCN Guidelines 
recommend pathologic confirmation of nodal status (see Pretreatment 
Evaluation in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).949,950 In addition, FDG 
PET/CT scans (if not previously done) and brain MRI with contrast should 
also be included in the pretreatment evaluation. If these imaging tests are 
negative, then treatment options for the appropriate nodal status should be 
followed (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). If N3 disease is 
confirmed, definitive concurrent chemoradiation (category 1) is 
recommended followed by durvalumab (category 1).386,634,694,699,951-953 
Durvalumab is recommended (category 1) as consolidation 
immunotherapy after treatment with definitive concurrent chemoradiation 
for eligible patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC (see Durvalumab

and Chemoradiation: Trial Data in this Discussion and the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).313 Durvalumab is not recommended for patients 
who have had definitive surgical resection. If patients will be receiving 
durvalumab but have not received full-dose chemotherapy concurrently 
with RT, the NCCN NSCLC Panel does not recommend an additional 2 
cycles of full-dose chemotherapy (ie, consolidation chemotherapy) based 
on concerns that adding consolidation chemotherapy will increase the 
risk of pneumonitis if patients are also receiving durvalumab. If patients 
will not be receiving durvalumab because of medical contraindications or 
other reasons, consolidation chemotherapy is an option after concurrent 
chemoradiation if patients have not received full-dose chemotherapy 
concurrently with RT. For metastatic disease that is confirmed by FDG 
PET/CT scan and brain MRI with contrast, treatment is described in the 
NCCN Guidelines for limited or metastatic disease.  
For patients with T4,N2–3 disease (stages IIIB and IIIC), surgical resection 
is not recommended. The initial workup includes biopsies of the N3 and 
N2 nodes. If these biopsies are negative, the same treatment options may 
be used as for stage IIIA (T4,N0–1) disease (see the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). If either the contralateral or ipsilateral mediastinal node is 
positive, definitive concurrent chemoradiation therapy is recommended 
(category 1) followed by durvalumab (see the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).386,634,694,699,951-954 Again, durvalumab is recommended (category 
1) as consolidation immunotherapy after treatment with definitive 
concurrent chemoradiation for eligible patients with unresectable stage III 
NSCLC.313 Two additional cycles of full-dose chemotherapy (consolidation 
chemotherapy) may be given if full-dose chemotherapy was not given 
concurrently with RT; however, consolidation chemotherapy is not 
recommended if patients will be receiving durvalumab.  
Limited Metastatic Disease  
In general, systemic therapy is recommended for patients with metastatic 
disease (see Systemic Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).781 In addition, palliative treatment, including 
RT, may be needed during the disease course to treat localized 
symptoms, diffuse brain metastases, or bone metastases (see Therapy for 
Recurrence and Metastasis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). This 
section focuses on patients with limited metastatic disease; management 
of widespread distant metastases is described in another section (see 
Treatment of Recurrences and Distant Metastases in this Discussion and 
Systemic Therapy for Metastatic Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).  
Pleural or pericardial effusion is a criterion for stage IV, M1a disease. T4 
with pleural effusion is classified as stage IV, M1a (see Table 3 in Staging 
in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).141 Pleural or pericardial effusions are 
malignant in 90% to 95% of patients; however, they may be related to 
obstructive pneumonitis, atelectasis, lymphatic or venous obstruction, or a 
pulmonary embolus. Therefore, pathologic confirmation of a malignant 
effusion by using thoracentesis or pericardiocentesis is recommended. In 
certain cases where thoracentesis is inconclusive, thoracoscopy may be 
performed. In the absence of nonmalignant causes (eg, obstructive 
pneumonia), an exudate or sanguinous effusion is considered malignant 
regardless of the results of cytologic examination. If the pleural or 
pericardial effusion is considered negative for malignancy (M0), 
recommended treatment is based on the confirmed T and N stage (see 
the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). All pleural or pericardial effusions, 
whether malignant or not, are associated with unresectable disease in 
95% of cases.955 In patients with effusions that are positive for malignancy, 
the tumor is defined as M1a and is treated with local therapy (ie, 
ambulatory small catheter drainage, pleurodesis, and pericardial window)

MS-73 
in addition to treatment as for stage IV disease (see the NCCN Guidelines 
for NSCLC).956  
Management of patients with distant metastases in limited sites (ie, stage 
IVA,M1b) and good PS depends on the location and number of the 
metastases; the diagnosis is aided by mediastinoscopy, bronchoscopy, 
FDG PET/CT scan, and brain MRI with contrast. The increased sensitivity 
of FDG PET/CT scans, compared with other imaging methods, may 
identify additional metastases and, thus, spare some patients from 
unnecessary futile surgery. Positive FDG PET/CT scan findings for distant 
disease need pathologic or other radiologic confirmation. If the FDG 
PET/CT scan is positive in the mediastinum, the lymph node status needs 
pathologic confirmation. Patients with limited oligometastatic disease (eg, 
brain metastases) and otherwise limited disease in the chest may benefit 
from aggressive local therapy to both the primary chest and metastatic 
sites.514,957 Clinicians are not using whole brain RT as often in patients with 
limited brain metastases because of concerns about neurocognitive 
problems.599 Therefore, the NCCN NSCLC Panel has decreased the 
recommendations for whole brain RT to treat limited brain metastases 
(see Whole Brain RT and Stereotactic Radiosurgery in this Discussion 
text). Aggressive local therapy may comprise surgery and/or definitive RT, 
including SRS and SABR, and may be preceded or followed by 
chemotherapy. After progression on TKIs, patients with EGFR mutation–
positive metastatic NSCLC may be able to continue with their current 
TKIs; local therapy can be considered to treat their limited metastases (eg, 
SRS to brain metastases or other sites, SABR for thoracic disease).958,959  
Preoperative and Postoperative Treatment  
Chemotherapy or Chemoradiation 
On the basis of clinical studies,622-624 the NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends cisplatin combined with docetaxel, etoposide, gemcitabine, 
or vinorelbine for preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy for all 
histologies in the NCCN Guidelines. For the 2020 update (Version 1), the 
NCCN NSCLC Panel preference stratified all the systemic therapy 
regimens and decided that cisplatin combined with pemetrexed is 
preferred for nonsquamous NSCLC, whereas cisplatin combined with 
either gemcitabine or docetaxel is preferred for squamous cell NSCLC 
(see Chemotherapy Regimens for Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Therapy in 
the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).668,673,704 Cisplatin combined with either 
vinorelbine or etoposide are “other recommended” options. For patients 
with comorbidities or those who cannot tolerate cisplatin, carboplatin may 
be combined with pemetrexed (nonsquamous only), paclitaxel, or 
gemcitabine; thus, these regimens are useful in certain 
circumstances.668,960 These regimens that are used for preoperative and 
postoperative chemotherapy may also be used for sequential 
chemoradiation.674-677  
Because patients with stage III disease have both local and distant 
failures, theoretically, the use of chemotherapy may eradicate 
micrometastatic disease obviously present but undetectable at diagnosis. 
The timing of this chemotherapy varies (see the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). Such chemotherapy may be given alone, sequentially, or 
concurrently with RT. In addition, chemotherapy could be given 
preoperatively or postoperatively in appropriate patients. Three phase 3 
trials have assessed preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery 
compared with surgery alone in the treatment of stage III NSCLC.629,961-963 
All 3 studies showed a survival advantage for patients who received 
preoperative chemotherapy. SWOG S9900—one of the largest 
randomized trials examining preoperative chemotherapy in early-stage 
NSCLC—assessed surgery alone compared with surgery plus 
preoperative paclitaxel/carboplatin in patients with stage IB/IIA and stage 
IIB/IIIA NSCLC (excluding superior sulcus tumors). PFS and overall 
survival were improved with preoperative chemotherapy.962,963 The 2 
earlier phase 3 studies had a small number of patients, while the SWOG

MS-74 
study was stopped early because of the positive results of the IALT study. 
A number of phase 2 studies have evaluated preoperative chemotherapy 
for stage III NSCLC, with (or without) RT, followed by surgery.964-966 
Post-surgical treatment options for patients with stage IA tumors 
(T1abc,N0) and with positive surgical margins (R1, R2) include 
re-resection (preferred) or RT (category 2B); observation is recommended 
for patients with negative surgical margins (R0). Postoperative 
chemotherapy is a category 2A recommendation for patients with T2ab,N0 
tumors and negative surgical margins who have high-risk features, 
including poorly differentiated tumors, vascular invasion, wedge resection, 
tumors >4 cm, visceral pleural involvement, and unknown lymph node 
status (Nx) (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).667,967 If the surgical 
margins are positive in patients with T2ab,N0 tumors, options include: 1) 
re-resection (preferred) with (or without) chemotherapy; or 2) RT with (or 
without) chemotherapy (chemotherapy is recommended for T2b,N0).403,667  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends chemotherapy (category 1) for 
patients with negative surgical margins and stage IIB disease, including 1) 
T1abc–T2a,N1; 2) T2b,N1; or 3) T3,N0 disease.663,968 If surgical margins 
are positive in these patients, options after an R1 resection include: 1) 
re-resection and chemotherapy; or 2) chemoradiation (either sequential or 
concurrent). Options after an R2 resection include: 1) re-resection and 
chemotherapy; or 2) concurrent chemoradiation. Most NCCN Member 
Institutions favor concurrent chemoradiation for positive margins, but 
sequential chemoradiation is reasonable in frailer patients.689 
Postoperative chemotherapy can also be used in patients with stage III 
NSCLC who have had surgery (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). 
Patients with T1–3,N2 or T3,N1 disease (discovered only at surgical 
exploration and mediastinal lymph node dissection) and positive margins 
may be treated with chemoradiation; either sequential or concurrent 
chemoradiation is recommended for an R1 resection, whereas concurrent 
chemoradiation is recommended for an R2 resection (see the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). Patients with negative margins may be treated 
with either 1) chemotherapy (category 1); or 2) sequential chemotherapy 
plus RT (adding RT is for N2 only).663  
For stage IIIA superior sulcus tumors (T4 extension,N0–1) that become 
resectable after preoperative concurrent chemoradiation, resection 
followed by chemotherapy is recommended (see the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). Surgical reevaluation (including chest CT with or without contrast 
and with or without PET/CT) is done to determine whether the tumor is 
resectable after treatment. If the lesion remains unresectable after 
preoperative concurrent chemoradiation, then adjuvant treatment with 
durvalumab (category 1) is recommended for eligible patients. Among 
patients with chest wall lesions with T3 invasion–T4 extension,N0–1 
disease, those who are initially treated with surgery (preferred) may 
receive chemotherapy alone if the surgical margins are negative. When 
surgical margins are positive, they may receive either 1) sequential or 
concurrent chemoradiation; or 2) re-resection and chemotherapy. As 
previously mentioned, most NCCN Member Institutions favor concurrent 
chemoradiation for positive margins, but sequential is reasonable in frailer 
patients.689 A similar treatment plan is recommended for resectable tumors 
of the proximal airway or mediastinum (T3–4,N0–1).  
For patients with stage III disease and positive mediastinal nodes (T1–
3,N2) with no apparent disease progression after initial treatment, 
recommended treatment includes surgery with (or without) RT (if not given 
preoperatively) (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Alternatively, if the 
disease progresses, patients may be treated with either 1) local therapy 
using RT (if not given previously) with (or without) chemotherapy; or 2) 
systemic therapy. In patients with separate pulmonary nodules in the 
same lobe (T3,N0–1) or ipsilateral non-primary lobe (T4,N0–1), surgery is 
recommended. In patients with N2 disease and negative margins, options

MS-75 
include 1) chemotherapy (category 1); or 2) sequential chemotherapy with 
radiation. If the resection margins are positive in patients with N2 disease, 
concurrent chemoradiation is recommended for an R2 resection, whereas 
either concurrent or sequential chemoradiation is recommended for an R1 
resection. Concurrent chemoradiation is often used for positive margins, 
but sequential is reasonable in frailer patients.  
Radiation Therapy 
After complete resection of clinical early-stage NSCLC, postoperative RT 
has been found to be detrimental for pathologic N0 or N1 stage disease in 
a meta-analysis (population-based analysis of data from SEER) of small 
randomized trials using older techniques and dosing regimens .969 There 
was an apparent survival benefit of postoperative RT in patients with N2 
nodal stage diagnosed surgically.504 The analysis of the ANITA trial also 
found that postoperative RT increased survival in patients with N2 disease 
who received chemotherapy.403 A review of the National Cancer Database 
concluded that postoperative RT and chemotherapy provided a survival 
advantage for patients with completely resected N2 disease when 
compared with chemotherapy alone.970 A meta-analysis also concluded 
that postoperative RT improves survival for patients with N2 disease.971 A 
meta-analysis assessed postoperative chemotherapy with (or without) 
postoperative RT in patients with mainly stage III disease.968 In this 
meta-analysis, 70% of the eligible trials used sequential chemotherapy 
before RT; 30% used concurrent chemo/RT. Regimens included 
cisplatin/vinorelbine followed by RT or concurrent cisplatin/etoposide. The 
ACR Appropriateness Criteria provide specific recommendations for 
postoperative therapy.972,973  
Postoperative sequential chemotherapy with RT is recommended for 
patients with T1–3, N2 disease and negative margins (see the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). Either concurrent or sequential chemoradiation 
may be used for postoperative therapy, depending on the type of resection 
and the setting (eg, N2 disease) (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). 
Concurrent chemo/RT is recommended for R2 resections, whereas either 
sequential or concurrent chemo/RT is recommended for R1 resections. 
Concurrent chemoradiation is often used for positive margins, but 
sequential is reasonable in frailer patients.689 Cisplatin/etoposide and 
carboplatin/paclitaxel are chemoradiation regimens recommended by the 
NCCN NSCLC Panel for all histologies (see Chemotherapy Regimens 
Used with Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).693 
Pemetrexed with either cisplatin or carboplatin may be used for concurrent 
chemoradiation in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC.696,974,975 When 
chemoradiation is recommended in the NCCN Guidelines, these regimens 
may be used for stage II to III disease.404,405,634,635,694,697,698  
PROCLAIM, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed concurrent thoracic RT 
with cisplatin/pemetrexed versus cisplatin/etoposide followed by 
consolidation chemotherapy in patients with unresectable stage III 
nonsquamous NSCLC.691 Both regimens were equivalent in terms of 
survival, but the cisplatin/pemetrexed regimen was associated with less 
neutropenia (24.4% vs. 44.5%; P < .001) and fewer grade 3 to 4 adverse 
events (64.0% vs. 76.8%; P = .001). The NCCN NSCLC Panel deleted the 
cisplatin/etoposide consolidation regimen based on the PROCLAIM trial.691 
In addition, the NCCN NSCLC Panel clarified that the cisplatin/pemetrexed 
and carboplatin/paclitaxel regimens may be followed by consolidation 
chemotherapy alone for eligible patients receiving definitive 
chemoradiation; however, these consolidation chemotherapy regimens 
should not be used if the patient will be receiving durvalumab.  
Surveillance  
Because recurrence is common after treatment for NSCLC, initial 
surveillance with history and physical (H&P) and chest CT (with or without 
contrast) is recommended in the NCCN Guidelines. Data from randomized 
phase 3 trials are not available to clarify surveillance recommendations;

therefore, the most appropriate schedules are controversial.976-980 The 
surveillance guidelines were compiled by polling the NCCN NSCLC Panel 
regarding their practice patterns. Details regarding the specific 
surveillance schedules for patients with no clinical or radiographic 
evidence of disease after completion of definitive therapy are outlined in 
the algorithm based on stage (see Surveillance in the NCCN Guidelines 
for NSCLC). Surveillance schedules for most patients with metastatic 
disease are individualized for each patient, although the NCCN Guidelines 
provide a surveillance schedule for certain patients with stage IV 
oligometastatic disease.  
NLST, a large randomized trial, assessed lung screening with low-dose 
CT screening versus chest radiography in individuals at high risk for lung 
cancer.66 Low-dose CT screening decreased mortality from lung cancer 
(mainly adenocarcinoma) compared with chest radiography (247 vs. 309 
deaths, respectively; 20% relative reduction in mortality; 95% CI, 6.8–26.7; 
P = .004).66 Low-dose CT is recommended for screening individuals at 
high risk for lung cancer (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer 
Screening). The NCCN NSCLC Panel feels that low-dose CT is beneficial 
for identifying recurrences in patients previously treated for NSCLC. It is 
important to note that the surveillance recommendations for patients who 
have been treated for NSCLC are different from the screening 
recommendations for individuals at high risk for lung cancer (see the 
NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening). 
The NCCN Guidelines recommend a chest CT scan with (or without) 
contrast and an H&P for the initial surveillance schedules (2–5 years) 
followed by an annual low-dose non-contrast–enhanced CT and an H&P 
(see Surveillance in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).978,979,981-984 Patients 
treated with chemotherapy with (or without) RT who have residual 
abnormalities may require more frequent imaging. FDG PET/CT or brain 
MRI is not routinely recommended for routine surveillance in patients 
without symptoms. But, PET may be useful for assessing CT scans that 
appear to show malignant neoplasms but may be radiation fibrosis, 
atelectasis, or other benign conditions. Areas previously treated with RT 
may remain FDG avid for up to 2 years; therefore, histologic confirmation 
of apparent “recurrent” disease is needed.985 For the 2020 update (Version 
1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel now recommends assessing patients with 
recurrences using PET/CT and brain MRI with contrast. Information about 
smoking cessation (eg, advice, counseling, therapy) should be provided 
for patients undergoing surveillance to improve their quality of life. 
The NCCN Guidelines include information about the long-term follow-up 
care of NSCLC survivors (see Cancer Survivorship Care in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). These recommendations include guidelines for 
routine cancer surveillance, immunizations, health monitoring, counseling 
for wellness and health promotion, and cancer screening. An analysis 
suggests that patients who survive lung cancer have a high symptom 
burden 1 year after diagnosis and therefore need management after 
treatment.986  
Treatment of Recurrences and Distant Metastases 
Recurrences are subdivided into locoregional recurrences and distant 
metastases. Management of locoregional recurrences or symptomatic 
local disease—endobronchial obstruction, mediastinal lymph node 
recurrence, superior vena cava (SVC) obstructions, severe hemoptysis—
is described in the NCCN Guidelines (see Therapy for Recurrence and 
Metastasis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).20 An SVC stent may be 
used with either concurrent chemoradiation or RT to treat SVC 
obstruction. For patients with endobronchial obstruction, relieving airway 
obstruction may increase survival, especially in patients who are severely 
compromised, and may improve their quality of life.987 After treatment for 
the locoregional recurrence, observation or systemic therapy (category 2B 
for systemic therapy) is recommended if disseminated disease is not

MS-77 
evident. Systemic therapy is recommended for disseminated disease. The 
type of systemic therapy depends on the histologic type, whether genetic 
variants are present that can be treated with targeted therapy, and PS 
(see Systemic Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends (category 
2A) response assessment after 2 cycles of systemic therapy, then after 
every 2 to 4 cycles of therapy or when clinically indicated; assessment is 
done using CT with (or without contrast) of known sites of disease.225,988-990  
Management of distant metastases—localized symptoms; bone, limited, 
diffuse brain, or disseminated metastases—is described in the NCCN 
Guidelines (see Therapy for Recurrence and Metastasis in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). Palliation of symptoms throughout the disease 
course can be achieved with external-beam RT for distant metastases with 
localized symptoms, diffuse brain metastases, or bone metastases 
(bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy can be considered).417,509,991 For 
patients at risk of fracture in weight-bearing bone, orthopedic stabilization 
and palliative RT are recommended.  
Of note, recurrent and metastatic disease have historically been regarded 
as incurable. However, selected limited locoregional recurrences may be 
treated with curative intent therapy (surgery or RT with [or without] 
chemotherapy) (see Therapy for Recurrence and Metastasis in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). Similarly, patients with limited-site oligometastatic 
disease and good PS may benefit from aggressive local therapies to the 
metastatic and primary sites, with clinical data suggesting the possibility of 
long-term survival (see Initial Treatment for Stage IVA, M1b in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).547,548,551,581,992-995 In addition, emerging clinical data 
suggest the feasibility of definitive reirradiation of local recurrences within 
prior RT fields using highly conformal techniques, although this should be 
limited to highly selected cases in specialty centers with appropriate 
expertise because of the potential for severe toxicity with high cumulative 
radiation doses to critical structures.414,558-560,996-999  
In patients with NSCLC who have bone metastases, data suggest that 
denosumab increases median overall survival when compared with 
zoledronic acid (9.5 vs. 8 months).1000 Denosumab and bisphosphonate 
therapy can be associated with severe hypocalcemia; patients with 
hypoparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency are at increased risk for 
hypocalcemia. Denosumab or intravenous bisphosphonate therapy can 
be considered in patients with bone metastases to decrease bone 
complications (eg, decrease pain, delay skeletal-related events) based on 
clinical trial data.158,1000-1004 The FDA has approved the use of zoledronic 
acid and denosumab in patients with bone metastases from solid 
tumors.1005,1006  
For patients with recurrent and metastatic disease, the NCCN Guidelines 
recommend that histologic subtype should be determined before therapy 
so that the best treatment can be selected (see Metastatic Disease: 
Histologic Subtype in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).704 In addition, 
biomarker testing for genetic variants (ie, oncogenic driver events) is 
recommended in patients with NSCLC, because targeted therapy has 
been shown to decrease tumor burden, decrease symptoms, and 
dramatically improve the quality of life for patients with specific genetic 
variants. The number of available targeted agents is increasing. In the 
NCCN Guidelines, several targeted agents are recommended for first-line 
therapy in patients with specific genetic variants such as erlotinib, gefitinib, 
afatinib, osimertinib, dacomitinib, alectinib, ceritinib, brigatinib, and 
crizotinib.781 Additional targeted therapies for patients with other genetic 
variants are also recommended, although there is less evidence for these 
agents and they have not been FDA approved for lung cancer (see 
Emerging Biomarkers to Identify Novel Therapies for Patients with 
Metastatic NSCLC in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Certain targeted

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
 
MS-78 
therapies—such as ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib, and 
osimertinib—are recommended as subsequent therapies (if not previously 
given) for patients with the indicated genetic variants whose disease 
becomes resistant to first-line targeted therapies; other targeted therapies 
are being investigated for resistance.  
Biomarker testing for genetic variants is recommended in the NCCN 
Guidelines based on the improved outcomes associated with use of 
targeted therapy in eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC (see Principles 
of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC 
and Predictive and Prognostic Biomarkers in this Discussion). It is 
important to note that 1) several different tests may be used to identify the 
same biomarker, including FDA-approved biomarker tests and validated 
laboratory tests done in CLIA-approved laboratories; and 2) biomarker 
testing is rapidly changing and improving. EGFR mutation testing 
(category 1) is recommended in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC (ie, 
adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma) or NSCLC NOS, because EGFR 
TKIs are recommended for patients who are positive for sensitizing EGFR 
mutations (see EGFR Mutation Positive/First-Line Therapy in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).105,200,209,212,1007 Testing for ALK fusions (category 
1) is also recommended in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, because 
ALK inhibitors are recommended for patients with metastatic NSCLC who 
are positive for ALK fusions.160,1008 The NCCN NSCLC Panel also 
recommends testing for ROS1 fusions (category 2A). Testing for ROS1 
has typically been done using FISH; a validated NGS platform that can 
detect this gene fusion may also be used.271 The NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends that EGFR and BRAF mutation testing be done as part of 
broad molecular profiling (eg, multiplex mutation screening assays or 
NGS). Testing for ALK gene fusions can be done with FISH or with NGS if 
the platform is validated and can identify gene fusions.181,198,199 The NCCN 
NSCLC Panel also recommends upfront PD-L1 expression testing 
(category 1) before first-line therapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC to 
assess whether patients are candidates for pembrolizumab (see 
Pembrolizumab in this Discussion).  
The following targeted agents are recommended (category 2A) for patients 
with emerging genetic variants: 1) crizotinib (for high-level MET 
amplification 2) ado-trastuzumab for ERBB2 mutations; 3) nivolumab with 
or without ipilimumab for patients with 
TMB.102,107,151-153,168,169,177,181,206,289-291,304,746,788,791,827,830,835,836,1009-1020 The 
NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends crizotinib for high-level MET 
amplification based on data from several studies.289,1021,1022 The NCCN 
NSCLC Panel recommends ado-trastuzumab emtansine (category 2A) for 
patients with ERBB2 (also known as HER2) mutations based on results 
from a phase 2 basket trial.178,1011 The partial response rate was 44% 
(95% CI, 22%–69%). The median PFS was 5 months (95% CI, 3–9). 
Minor toxicities (grade 1–2) included infusion reactions, thrombocytopenia, 
and transaminitis; no treatment-related deaths were reported. Patients (n 
= 18) were mostly women (72%), nonsmokers, and all had 
adenocarcinomas. The NCCN NSCLC Panel does not recommend 
single-agent therapy with trastuzumab or afatinib (both for ERBB2 
mutations), because response rates are lower and treatment is less 
effective when these agents are used for patients with ERBB2 
mutations.1023,1024  
As previously mentioned, recommendations from an international panel 
suggest that general histologic categories be avoided in patients with 
NSCLC (eg, NSCLC), because more effective treatment can be selected 
when the histology is known.74 Patients with pure squamous cell 
carcinoma do not seem to have ALK fusions, ROS1 fusions, RET 
rearrangements, sensitizing EGFR mutations, METex14 skipping 
mutations, or BRAF V600E mutations; therefore, routine molecular testing 
is not recommended in these patients.161,163,1025,1026 However, molecular 
testing for ALK fusions, ROS1 fusions, RET rearrangements, BRAF

MS-79 
mutations, METex14 skipping mutations, or EGFR mutations can be 
considered in patients with squamous cell carcinomas whose histology 
was determined using small biopsy specimens or mixed histology 
specimens.161 Molecular testing for EGFR mutations or ALK fusions can 
also be considered in patients who never smoked. Treatment 
recommendations and eligibility criteria are described in the NCCN 
Guidelines for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC (or NSCLC NOS) with 
negative test results for ALK fusions or sensitizing EGFR mutations and 
with PD-L1 expression less than 1%. Treatment recommendations and 
eligibility criteria for patients with squamous cell carcinoma are also 
described in the NCCN Guidelines. These recommendations are briefly 
summarized in the following paragraphs. Data supporting these 
recommendations are described in the following section (see Trial Data in 
this Discussion).  
Chemotherapy/immunotherapy regimens are recommended for patients 
without genetic variants (see Systemic Therapy for Advanced or 
Metastatic Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Single-agent 
targeted therapy is recommended for patients with EGFR, ALK, BRAF 
V600E, METex14 skipping, RET, or ROS1 variants or other emerging 
driver mutations (see Targeted Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic 
Disease and Emerging Biomarkers to Identify Novel Therapies for Patients 
with Metastatic NSCLC in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).  
Chemotherapy/immunotherapy regimens, such as 
pembrolizumab/carboplatin (or cisplatin)/pemetrexed, are recommended 
for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC and negative test results for 
EGFR, ALK, ROS1, METex14 skipping, RET, or BRAF genetic variants 
(also known as wild-type), regardless of PD-L1 expression (see Systemic 
Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC, the NCCN Drugs & Biologics Compendium [NCCN 
Compendium®] for NSCLC, and the NCCN Guidelines with Evidence 
Blocks™ for NSCLC).704  
For patients with metastatic NSCLC and contraindications to 
pembrolizumab or other ICIs, chemotherapy options are recommended 
(such as carboplatin/paclitaxel), although some regimens may be more 
appropriate for certain patients, depending on histology, PS, and other 
factors (see Trial Data in this Discussion, and Systemic Therapy for 
Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC, the 
NCCN Compendium® for NSCLC, and the NCCN Guidelines with 
Evidence Blocks™ for NSCLC).781,1027 Chemotherapy with or without 
bevacizumab is an option if eligibility criteria are met for patients with 
nonsquamous NSCLC and negative test results for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, 
METex14 skipping, RET, or BRAF variants and with PD-L1 expression 
less than 1%.1028 Previously, patients with brain metastases were 
excluded from receiving bevacizumab because of concerns about CNS 
hemorrhage; however, data suggest that bevacizumab can be used in 
patients with treated CNS metastases.1029 A phase 3 randomized trial in 
elderly patients (70–89 years) with advanced NSCLC reported that 
combined therapy with weekly paclitaxel and monthly carboplatin 
improved survival when compared with single-agent therapy using either 
gemcitabine or vinorelbine (10.3 vs. 6.2 months).1030 Systemic therapy for 
elderly patients with advanced NSCLC needs to be carefully selected to 
avoid adverse reactions.1031 The NCCN NSCLC Panel previously revised 
the lists of recommended doublet and single-agent cytotoxic 
chemotherapy regimens for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC or 
NSCLC NOS—who are negative for mutations, fusions, or PD-L1 
expression—by deleting regimens that are rarely used in the United 
States. Deleted regimens include carboplatin/vinorelbine, 
cisplatin/vinorelbine, etoposide, irinotecan, and vinorelbine.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
 
MS-80 
For patients with metastatic squamous cell NSCLC and negative test 
results for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, METex14 skipping, RET, or BRAF variants 
and with PD-L1 expression less than 1%, chemotherapy/immunotherapy 
regimens—such as pembrolizumab/carboplatin with either paclitaxel or 
albumin-bound paclitaxel—are recommended (category 1; preferred). For 
patients with metastatic squamous cell NSCLC who have 
contraindications to pembrolizumab, recommended options include 
cisplatin/gemcitabine (category 1).704 Carboplatin/paclitaxel, 
carboplatin/gemcitabine (category 1 for both), and other regimens listed in 
the NSCLC algorithm are also recommended (see Systemic Therapy for 
Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC, the 
NCCN Compendium® for NSCLC, and the NCCN Guidelines with 
Evidence Blocks™ for NSCLC). The NCCN NSCLC Panel previously 
revised the lists of recommended doublet cytotoxic therapy regimens by 
deleting regimens that are rarely used for patients with metastatic 
squamous cell NSCLC and negative test results for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, 
METex14 skipping, RET, or BRAF variants and with PD-L1 expression 
less than 1%. Deleted regimens include carboplatin/etoposide, 
carboplatin/vinorelbine, cisplatin/vinorelbine, 
cisplatin/gemcitabine/necitumumab, etoposide, irinotecan, and vinorelbine. 
Regimens containing pemetrexed or bevacizumab are not recommended 
for squamous cell carcinoma. Currently, fewer treatment options are 
available for patients with squamous cell carcinoma compared with 
nonsquamous NSCLC. Research is ongoing to find newer 
options.7,102,199,1032,1033  
Trial Data 
Data show that platinum-based combination therapy is superior to best 
supportive care for patients with advanced, incurable disease who are not 
eligible for targeted therapy or immunotherapy. Cisplatin or carboplatin 
have been proven effective in combination with many of the following 
agents: docetaxel, etoposide, gemcitabine, paclitaxel (and albumin-bound 
paclitaxel), pemetrexed, and vinorelbine (see Systemic Therapy for 
Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).668,673,702-704,711,712,732 Carboplatin-based regimens are often used 
for patients with comorbidities or those who cannot tolerate cisplatin.1034 
Non-platinum regimens (eg, gemcitabine/docetaxel, 
gemcitabine/vinorelbine) are reasonable alternatives, because data show 
they are active and less toxic than platinum-based regimens.714-717,1035  
ECOG 4599, a phase 2/3 trial, randomly assigned 878 patients to either 1) 
bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin; or 2) 
paclitaxel/carboplatin alone.720,1036 Both regimens were well tolerated with 
selected toxicities. Patients receiving bevacizumab/paclitaxel/carboplatin 
showed an improved median survival (12.3 vs. 10.3 months, P = .003) 
when compared to patients receiving paclitaxel/carboplatin alone.720 The 
overall 1-year and 2-year survival were 51% versus 44% and 23% versus 
15%, respectively, in favor of the bevacizumab/paclitaxel/carboplatin 
arm.720 More significant toxicities were observed with 
bevacizumab/paclitaxel/carboplatin compared to paclitaxel/carboplatin 
(grade 4 neutropenia: 25.5% vs. 16.8%; grade 5 hemoptysis: 1.2% vs. 0%; 
and grade 3 hypertension: 6.8% vs. 0.5%). Treatment-related deaths were 
more common with bevacizumab/paclitaxel/carboplatin (15 patients) than 
with paclitaxel/carboplatin (2 patients) (P = .001). An analysis of ECOG 
4599 found that patients with adenocarcinoma histology receiving 
bevacizumab/paclitaxel/carboplatin had improved survival compared with 
chemotherapy alone (14.2 vs. 10.3 months).1028 AVAiL, a phase 3 
randomized trial, compared cisplatin/gemcitabine with (or without) 
bevacizumab; survival was not increased with the addition of 
bevacizumab.1037,1038 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends that 
bevacizumab biosimilars may be used in any of the systemic therapy 
regimens containing bevacizumab (eg, carboplatin plus paclitaxel plus 
bevacizumab) that are used for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC 
based on clinical data and FDA approvals.753-757

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
 
MS-81 
A noninferiority trial in 1725 patients with advanced NSCLC (either stage 
IIIB or IV; most were stage IV) assessed cisplatin/gemcitabine compared 
with cisplatin/pemetrexed.704 Patients with either adenocarcinoma or large 
cell carcinoma (ie, nonsquamous NSCLC) had improved survival with 
cisplatin/pemetrexed (adenocarcinoma: 12.6 vs. 10.9 months). Patients 
with squamous cell carcinoma had improved survival with the 
cisplatin/gemcitabine regimen (10.8 vs. 9.4 months). When compared with 
the cisplatin/gemcitabine regimen, the cisplatin/pemetrexed regimen had 
significantly lower rates of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, anemia, and 
thrombocytopenia (P ≤ .001); febrile neutropenia (P = .002); and alopecia 
(P < .001). Treatment-related deaths were similar for both regimens 
(cisplatin/pemetrexed, 9 patients [1.0%]; cisplatin/gemcitabine, 6 patients 
[0.7%]). An analysis of three phase 3 trials confirmed that pemetrexed 
improves survival for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC in first-line, 
subsequent, and maintenance therapy.1039  
Number of Cycles of First-Line Systemic Therapy  
Data from the PARAMOUNT trial suggest that 4 cycles of platinum-based 
therapy is not optimal;880 tumors can shrink between 4 to 6 cycles of 
chemotherapy. However, patients may not be able to tolerate more than 4 
cycles of chemotherapy, and most of the maintenance trials used only 4 
cycles of chemotherapy.724 A meta-analysis suggests that continuing the 
initial regimen beyond 4 to 6 cycles is associated with increased PFS; 
however, patients have more adverse events.1040 A phase 3 randomized 
trial suggested that continuing chemotherapy beyond 4 to 6 cycles is not 
beneficial; however, many patients assigned to a longer duration of 
therapy did not receive the planned number of cycles.721,722 In this phase 3 
trial, taxane-based regimens were used and patients had increasing 
neurotoxicity as more cycles were used.721  
Many patients with adenocarcinoma receive pemetrexed-based regimens 
and not taxane-based regimens. Pemetrexed-based regimens are less 
toxic than taxane-based regimens. Thus, data suggesting that more than 6 
cycles of first-line chemotherapy are not appropriate may only apply to 
taxane-based regimens.724 Studies report that 60% of patients were able 
to receive 6 cycles of pemetrexed-based chemotherapy (and had a low 
incidence of toxicity), whereas only 42% were able to receive more than 5 
cycles of taxane-based chemotherapy and often stopped therapy because 
of neurotoxicity.721,878  
The NCCN Guidelines recommend that patients receiving first-line 
systemic therapy for advanced disease should be evaluated for tumor 
response with a CT scan. Response assessment should occur after 2 
cycles and then every 2 to 4 cycles using CT of known sites of disease 
(with or without contrast) or when clinically indicated.225,988-990 
Approximately 25% of patients show disease progression after the initial 
cycle of chemotherapy; subsequent therapy is recommended for these 
patients (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Patients with responsive 
or stable disease can continue to receive a total of 4 to 6 cycles of 
systemic therapy.644,721,1041 The NCCN Guidelines do not recommend 
continuing chemotherapy beyond 4 to 6 cycles. Generally, patients with 
metastatic NSCLC receive 4 cycles of initial systemic chemotherapy (eg, 
carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab for nonsquamous NSCLC) 
before starting maintenance therapy. However, if patients are tolerating 
the therapy, then 6 cycles of systemic therapy can be considered.  
Maintenance Therapy  
Maintenance therapy is an option for patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous NSCLC, with responsive or stable disease after first-line 
systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy (see the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC). Continuation maintenance therapy includes bevacizumab 
(category 1), pemetrexed (category 1), bevacizumab/pemetrexed 
(category 2A), pembrolizumab/pemetrexed (category 1), pembrolizumab 
(category 1), atezolizumab/bevacizumab (category 1), atezolizumab

(category 2A), or gemcitabine (category 2B) (see the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).672,720,726,837,880,883,884 Switch maintenance therapy for these 
patients includes pemetrexed (category 2A).672,884,887,888  
A phase 3 randomized trial in 663 patients with advanced NSCLC 
assessed the effect of best supportive care with (or without) switch 
maintenance pemetrexed in patients who had received platinum-based 
chemotherapy but had not progressed.888 Overall survival was 13.4 
months (95% CI, 11.9–15.9) with pemetrexed compared with 10.6 months 
(95% CI, 8.7–12.0) with placebo (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.42–0.61; P < 
.0001). Maintenance therapy is discussed in greater detail earlier in this 
Discussion (see Combined Modality Therapy: Maintenance Therapy).  
IUNO, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed erlotinib as switch 
maintenance therapy (and as subsequent therapy) for patients with 
nonsquamous NSCLC and PS 0 to 2 but without EGFR mutations.890 
Overall survival and PFS were not improved in patients receiving erlotinib 
when compared with placebo. The NCCN NSCLC Panel previously 
deleted the recommendation for erlotinib as switch maintenance therapy 
(and as subsequent therapy) for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC and 
PS 0 to 2 but without EGFR mutations based on results IUNO and a 
revised indication by the FDA.890  
IFCT-GFPC 0502, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared maintenance 
therapy with either gemcitabine or erlotinib after initial cytotoxic therapy 
with cisplatin-gemcitabine in patients with advanced NSCLC.672,884 
Continuation maintenance therapy with single-agent gemcitabine 
increased PFS to a greater extent (3.8 months) than switch maintenance 
therapy with erlotinib (2.9 months) compared with observation (1.9 
months).672,884 For patients with squamous cell NSCLC, gemcitabine 
(category 2B) is recommended as continuation maintenance therapy 
based on this trial (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).884,887 The 
benefits of continuation maintenance therapy were very slight; therefore, 
the recommendation is only category 2B for maintenance therapy with 
gemcitabine. A phase 3 trial assessed switch maintenance therapy with 
docetaxel given either immediately after chemotherapy or delayed until 
progression in patients with advanced NSCLC.892 Docetaxel is 
recommended (category 2B) as switch maintenance therapy for with 
squamous cell NSCLC based on this trial. Switch maintenance therapy 
with docetaxel is a category 2B recommendation in the NCCN Guidelines, 
because many patients in the delayed chemotherapy arm did not receive 
docetaxel.1042 For patients with squamous cell NSCLC, pembrolizumab is 
recommended as continuation maintenance therapy if patients received 
either pembrolizumab/carboplatin/(paclitaxel or albumin-bound 
paclitaxel) or pembrolizumab alone (see Pembrolizumab in this 
Discussion). 
Continuation of Targeted Therapy After Progression on Initial 
Therapy  
Patients may continue to derive benefit from EGFR TKIs or ALK inhibitors 
after disease progression on first-line therapy; discontinuation of these 
TKIs leads to more rapid progression of disease (symptoms, tumor size, 
FDG-avidity on PET scan) that is termed the flare phenomenon.747-750 This 
strategy mirrors the experience in other oncogene-addicted cancers, such 
as ALK inhibitors.748 After development of acquired resistance in patients 
with lung adenocarcinoma and sensitizing EGFR mutations, erlotinib, 
gefitinib, afatinib, dacomitinib, or osimertinib may be continued, but 
osimertinib as second-line therapy is also an option for select patients; 
local therapy should be considered (eg, SRS to brain metastases or other 
sites, SABR for thoracic disease).586,958,959,1043,1044  
Accumulating data suggest how cancers become resistant to EGFR 
inhibitors.1045 The most common known mechanism is the acquisition of 
T790M (which is a secondary mutation in EGFR), which renders the 
kinase resistant to erlotinib, gefitinib, dacomitinib, or afatinib.1046,1047

MS-83 
Therefore, if patients are T790M positive, osimertinib is recommended 
(category 1) and erlotinib, gefitinib, dacomitinib, or afatinib are 
discontinued. Amplification of the MET oncogene is another validated 
resistance mechanism. To overcome resistance, EGFR must still be 
inhibited. In the case of MET amplification, new inhibitors must be added 
to the EGFR inhibitor; EGFR inhibition is still required to induce remission. 
Furthermore, data show that when cancers start to progress, which were 
once sensitive to EGFR inhibitors, discontinuation of the EGFR TKI can 
lead to a much more accelerated progression of the cancer.747,749 Thus, 
continuing EGFR TKIs is beneficial in many patients even after they 
develop resistance to EGFR TKIs.1044  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends continuing erlotinib, gefitinib, 
afatinib, dacomitinib, or osimertinib and considering local therapy in 
patients with asymptomatic progression; however, treatment varies for 
patients with symptomatic progression (see Sensitizing EGFR Mutation 
Positive: Subsequent Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for 
NSCLC).1017,1043,1048-1050 Osimertinib is recommended (category 1) for 
patients with symptomatic brain metastases and T790M who have 
progressed on erlotinib, gefitinib, dacomitinib, or afatinib.226 Another option 
is to continue use of erlotinib, gefitinib, dacomitinib, or afatinib for these 
patients with symptomatic brain metastases; additional therapy may be 
added or substituted (eg, local therapy, systemic therapy). First-line 
systemic therapy options are recommended for patients with multiple 
symptomatic lesions who are negative for T790M; osimertinib is 
recommended (category 1) as subsequent therapy for patients positive for 
T790M who have progressed on erlotinib, gefitinib, dacomitinib, or afatinib. 
After progression on osimertinib, patients with sensitizing EGFR 
mutations may continue to derive benefit from osimertinib; other options 
are also recommended [see Second-Line and Beyond (Subsequent) 
Systemic Therapy in this Discussion]. After progression on alectinib, 
brigatinib, crizotinib, or ceritinib, patients with ALK fusions may continue 
to derive benefit from these agents; other options are also recommended 
[see Second-Line and Beyond (Subsequent) Systemic Therapy in this 
Discussion].  
Second-Line and Beyond (Subsequent) Systemic Therapy 
The phrase subsequent therapy was previously substituted for the terms 
second-line, third-line, and beyond systemic therapy, because the line of 
therapy may vary depending on previous treatment with targeted agents. 
Subsequent systemic therapy regimens for patients who have disease 
progression during or after first-line therapy are described in the NSCLC 
algorithm and depend on the specific genetic variant, the histologic 
subtype, and whether the patient has symptoms (see the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC).1051-1060 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
response assessment of known sites of disease with CT with contrast 
every 6 to 12 weeks in patients receiving subsequent therapy. Note that 
traditional RECIST response criteria (1.1) are used to assess response for 
most types of systemic therapy, but different response criteria may be 
useful for assessing response in patients receiving PD-1 or PD-L1 
inhibitors.225,988,990,1061,1062  
If patients have not previously received an ICI, the NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends (category 1) pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or atezolizumab as 
preferred agents for subsequent therapy in patients with metastatic 
NSCLC based on improved survival rates, longer duration of response, 
and fewer adverse events when compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy 
(see Pembrolizumab, Atezolizumab, and Nivolumab with or Without 
Ipilimumab in this Discussion).309,312,860 Human ICI antibodies inhibit the 
PD-1 receptor or PD-L1, which improves antitumor immunity; PD-1 
receptors are expressed on activated cytotoxic T cells.309-311 The NCCN 
NSCLC Panel recommends nivolumab (category 1) as subsequent 
therapy for patients with metastatic nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC 
based on the CheckMate 017 and CheckMate 057 clinical trials and FDA

approvals.309,864 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends pembrolizumab 
(category 1) as subsequent therapy for patients with metastatic 
nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC and PD-L1 expression >1% based on 
the KEYNOTE-010 and KEYNOTE-001 trials, and on FDA approval.840,853 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel also recommends atezolizumab (category 1) as 
subsequent therapy for patients with metastatic nonsquamous or 
squamous NSCLC based on the OAK and POPLAR trials, and FDA 
approval.314,839,860 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends osimertinib 
(category 1) as subsequent therapy for patients with metastatic EGFR 
T790M-positive NSCLC who have progressed on erlotinib, gefitinib, 
dacomitinib, or afatinib therapy based on clinical trial data and on the FDA 
approval (see Osimertinib in this Discussion).226,243  
For patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations who progress during or after 
first-line erlotinib, afatinib, gefitinib, dacomitinib, or osimertinib therapy, 
recommended subsequent therapy depends on whether the progression is 
asymptomatic or symptomatic and includes: 1) considering local therapy; 
2) continuing erlotinib, afatinib, gefitinib, dacomitinib, or osimertinib; 3) 
taking osimertinib if not previously given and T790M positive; or 4) taking 
a first-line systemic therapy regimen for nonsquamous NSCLC, such as 
cisplatin/pemetrexed. The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends osimertinib 
(category 1) for patients with metastatic NSCLC and T790M who have 
brain metastases and have progressed on erlotinib, afatinib, dacomitinib, 
or gefitinib.226,769-771 Data suggest that an afatinib/cetuximab regimen may 
be useful for patients who have progressed after receiving erlotinib, 
afatinib, or gefitinib and after chemotherapy.1063 Patients with 
T790M-positive and T790M-negative tumors had a similar response rate 
to an afatinib/cetuximab regimen (32% vs. 25%; P = .341). The NCCN 
NSCLC Panel recommends (category 2A) considering an 
afatinib/cetuximab regimen for patients who have progressed after 
receiving erlotinib, afatinib, dacomitinib, or gefitinib and chemotherapy 
based on these data.  
Subsequent therapy is recommended for patients with advanced NSCLC 
and sensitizing EGFR mutations who progress during or after first-line 
therapy with osimertinib. Recommended subsequent therapy depends on 
whether the progression is asymptomatic or symptomatic and includes: 1) 
considering local therapy; and/or 2) continuing osimertinib or switching to 
a first-line systemic therapy regimen for nonsquamous NSCLC (such as 
cisplatin/pemetrexed). There are no data to support using erlotinib, 
gefitinib, dacomitinib, or afatinib after progression on osimertinib.  
Among patients with sensitizing EFGR mutations, no improvement in 
overall survival has been noted in the phase 3 trials assessing subsequent 
therapy with pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or atezolizumab compared to 
docetaxel, but there were not enough patients with these mutations to 
determine whether there were statistically significant 
differences.309,751,840,860 The PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors were not worse than 
chemotherapy and were better tolerated. In the phase 3 trials for 
pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or atezolizumab versus docetaxel as 
subsequent therapy for patients with metastatic NSCLC, subset analyses 
were done in patients with EGFR mutations to determine the best 
subsequent therapy.309,840,860 The HRs for overall survival do not favor 
docetaxel over nivolumab (HR, 1.18; CI, 0.69–2.0), pembrolizumab (HR, 
0.88; CI, 0.45–1.7), or atezolizumab (HR, 1.24; CI, 0.7–2.2); the CIs for 
the HRs are wide probably because there were so few patients with EGFR 
mutations. The HRs for PFS do favor docetaxel for patients with EGFR 
mutations when compared with either pembrolizumab (HR, 1.79; CI, 0.94–
3.42) or nivolumab (HR, 1.46; CI, 0.90–2.37). But again, the CIs are wide. 
The evidence is weak for recommending docetaxel, pembrolizumab, 
nivolumab, or atezolizumab as subsequent therapy for patients with EGFR 
mutations. A recent meta-analysis suggests that docetaxel improves 
overall survival when compared with pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or 
atezolizumab.1064 Data suggest that patients with EGFR mutations or ALK 
fusions have a low response rate to PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors when

MS-85 
compared with patients without these genetic variants (response rate, 
3.6% vs. 23%, respectively).751,1064 Therefore, subsequent therapy with 
pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or atezolizumab is not recommended in 
patients with EGFR mutations or ALK fusions. Patients with ALK-positive 
NSCLC and very high PD-L1 expression do not respond to 
pembrolizumab.751 In addition, those with METex14 mutations and high 
PD-L1 expression do not respond to immunotherapy.249,293  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends lorlatinib (category 2A) as a 
subsequent therapy option for select patients with ALK-positive metastatic 
NSCLC who have progressed after treatment with ALK inhibitors (see 
Lorlatinib in this Discussion). For patients with ALK fusions who progress 
during or after first-line targeted therapy, recommended subsequent 
therapy depends on whether the progression is asymptomatic or 
symptomatic and includes: 1) considering local therapy (eg, SABR, SRS, 
surgery); 2) continuing alectinib, brigatinib, crizotinib, or ceritinib; 3) taking 
alectinib, brigatinib, or ceritinib (if all were not previously given) or 
lorlatinib; or 4) taking a first-line systemic therapy regimen for 
nonsquamous NSCLC. After further progression on subsequent targeted 
therapy, options include: 1) lorlatinib; or 2) first-line combination 
chemotherapy options for NSCLC (eg, carboplatin/paclitaxel), which are 
recommended for patients with PS of 0 to 1.158,1065 Other chemotherapy 
options are also recommended for patients with PS 2, such as docetaxel 
(see Systemic Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the NCCN 
Guidelines for NSCLC). The panel also recommends lorlatinib (category 
2A) as a subsequent therapy option for select patients with ROS1-positive 
metastatic NSCLC who have progressed after treatment with crizotinib or 
ceritinib.  
The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends capmatinib or crizotinib as 
subsequent therapy options for select patients with metastatic NSCLC and 
METex14 skipping mutations who have not previously received either 
agent (see Oral TKIs that Inhibit MET Exon 14 Skipping Mutations in this 
Discussion in this Discussion). The panel recommends selpercatinib, 
pralsetinib, cabozantinib, or vandetanib (category 2B for vandetanib) as 
subsequent therapy options for select patients with RET rearrangement 
positive metastatic NSCLC who have not previously received these agents 
(see Oral TKIs that Inhibit RET Rearrangements in this Discussion).  
Most patients with NSCLC do not have EGFR, ALK, ROS1, METex14 
skipping, RET, or BRAF variants. For patients with all histologic subtypes 
and PS of 0 to 2 but without these genetic variants who have disease 
progression during or after initial cytotoxic therapy, recommended 
subsequent systemic therapy options include PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors 
(nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or atezolizumab [category 1 for all] if any 
were not previously given) or chemotherapy (docetaxel with or without 
ramucirumab, or gemcitabine if not already given; pemetrexed is 
recommended for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC) if not already 
given. If ICIs have not previously been given, the NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends (category 1) nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or atezolizumab as 
preferred options for subsequent therapy for all histologic subtypes based 
on improved survival rates, longer duration of response, and fewer 
adverse events when compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy (see (see 
Pembrolizumab, Atezolizumab, and Nivolumab with or Without 
Ipilimumab in this Discussion).309,312,860  
PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors are superior to docetaxel; however, some 
patients cannot tolerate immunotherapy. Ramucirumab/docetaxel is an 
option for all histologic subtypes for subsequent therapy based on a phase 
3 randomized trial (see Ramucirumab in this Discussion).759 Docetaxel has 
been proven superior to best supportive care, vinorelbine, or ifosfamide 
with improved survival and quality of life.1057,1058 When compared with 
docetaxel, pemetrexed has similar median survival but less toxicity.1059,1066 
Pemetrexed is recommended in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC.888

Docetaxel is recommended for patients with wild-type EGFR tumors based 
on 2 randomized trials comparing erlotinib versus docetaxel.1067,1068 In 
patients with PS of 3 to 4, best supportive care is recommended (see the 
NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).20,651,652 Patients often have a limited 
response to subsequent chemotherapy other than ICIs, although 
chemotherapy may serve a useful palliative role.1069  
Subsequent therapy is recommended for certain patients after second 
disease progression if the following agents have not already been given: 
1) nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or atezolizumab if none has been 
previously given (all are category 2A); 2) docetaxel with or without 
ramucirumab (category 2B for both); 3) gemcitabine (category 2B); or 4) 
pemetrexed (nonsquamous only) (category 2B).1052,1068,1070,1071 These 
patients include those with advanced NSCLC, a PS of 0 to 2, and PD-L1 
less than 1%. 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel previously deleted the recommendation for 
erlotinib as subsequent therapy (and as switch maintenance therapy) for 
patients with nonsquamous NSCLC and PS of 0 to 2 but without EGFR 
mutations based on results from a randomized trial (IUNO) and revised 
indication by the FDA.890 Data showed that overall survival and PFS were 
not improved in patients receiving erlotinib when compared with placebo. 
The NCCN NSCLC Panel deleted erlotinib as an option for subsequent 
therapy for patients with squamous cell NSCLC based on a study 
comparing afatinib with erlotinib; this study was statistically significant but 
not clinically significant.795 Overall survival was 7.9 months (95% CI, 7.2–
8.7) for afatinib versus 6.8 months (95% CI, 5.9–7.8) for erlotinib (HR, 
0.81; 95% CI, 0.69–0.95; P = .0077); however, almost 60% of patients in 
each arm had grade 3 or higher adverse events. In contrast, the median 
overall survival was 9.2 months with nivolumab compared with 6.0 months 
for docetaxel for patients with squamous cell NSCLC.312 In addition, only 
7% of patients receiving nivolumab had grade 3 or higher adverse events. 
Erlotinib and afatinib are not recommended as second-line therapy for 
patients with squamous cell NSCLC based on a phase 3 randomized trial 
showing low response rates; they are less efficacious and safe compared 
to other available options.795  
Doublet chemotherapy options used for initial cytotoxic therapy are 
recommended for patients with metastatic NSCLC (eg, 
carboplatin/paclitaxel) and genetic variants who progress with 
symptomatic systemic multiple lesions after first-line targeted therapy.720 
The IMPRESS trial indicated that chemotherapy should be used alone and 
not be combined with EGFR inhibitors, such as gefitinib, in patients who 
have progressed on gefitinib.1072 Erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, dacomitinib, or 
osimertinib may be continued in patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations 
who have progressed after first-line therapy, depending on the type of 
progression.200,1017,1049,1050 Osimertinib is recommended for patients with 
T790M whose disease becomes resistant to erlotinib, afatinib, or 
gefitinib.243 Afatinib/cetuximab may be considered for second progression 
for patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations who have progressed after 
erlotinib, gefitinib, dacomitinib, or afatinib and after doublet 
chemotherapy.1063 Ceritinib, alectinib, or brigatinib are recommended in 
patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who have progressed after first-line 
therapy with crizotinib or for patients who are intolerant to 
crizotinib.156,822,824 Flare phenomenon may occur in some patients who 
discontinue EGFR or ALK inhibitors. If disease flare occurs, then EGFR or 
ALK inhibitors should be restarted.747-750  
For patients with metastatic NSCLC who have progressed after first-line 
therapy with single-agent pembrolizumab, platinum-based doublet therapy 
is recommended (eg, carboplatin/paclitaxel). For patients with metastatic 
NSCLC who have progressed after first-line therapy with PD-1/PD-L1 
inhibitors/chemotherapy, subsequent therapy with docetaxel (with or 
without ramucirumab), pemetrexed (for nonsquamous only), or

gemcitabine is recommended. Clinical trials are also recommended in 
these settings.  
Summary 
The NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC are updated at least once a year by the 
NCCN NSCLC Panel; there were 7 updates to the 2019 guidelines. The 
Summary of the Guidelines Updates describes the most recent revisions 
to the algorithms, which have been incorporated into this updated 
Discussion text (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). A brief summary 
of some of the recent updates is as follows: for the 2020 update (Version 
1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel has preference stratified the systemic therapy 
regimens based on the biomedical literature and experience of the panel 
members using the following categories: 1) preferred interventions; 2) 
other recommended interventions; and 3) interventions that are useful in 
certain circumstances. The NCCN NSCLC Panel has also preference 
stratified the new regimens that were added with each of the version 
updates for 2020 (Versions 2-6). These new preference categories are 
intended to emphasize the preferred regimens in clinical practice and are 
not intended to replace the NCCN Categories of Evidence and 
Consensus, such as category 1 or category 2A.  
For the 2020 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel deleted “or 
unknown” regarding test results for actionable molecular or immune 
biomarkers, because the panel feels that clinicians should obtain 
biomarker test results for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC before 
administering first-line therapy, if clinically feasible.22 Patients with 
metastatic NSCLC and PD-L1 expression levels of 1% or more—but who 
also have a targetable driver oncogene molecular variant (eg, EGFR, 
ALK)—should receive first-line targeted therapy for that oncogene and not 
first-line immunotherapy regimens, because targeted therapies yield 
higher response rates (eg, osimertinib, 80%) than immunotherapy 
regimens (poor response rates) in the first-line setting, targeted therapy is 
better tolerated, and these patients are unlikely to respond to 
ICIs.249,321-323,751 For the 2020 update (Version 1, Version 4), the NCCN 
NSCLC Panel added ROS1 fusions, RET rearrangements, METex14 
skipping mutations, and BRAF mutations to the list of actionable 
biomarkers that need to be negative before administering immunotherapy 
regimens; the complete list is as follows: EGFR, ALK, ROS1, METex14 
skipping, RET, and BRAF variants.183 
For the 2020 update (Version 2), the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
the following systemic therapy regimens as options for certain patients 
with metastatic NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 levels: 1) erlotinib plus either 
ramucirumab (category 2A) or bevacizumab (category 2B) for EGFR 
mutation–positive metastatic disease; 2) atezolizumab plus carboplatin 
plus albumin-bound paclitaxel (category 2A) for metastatic nonsquamous 
NSCLC with negative test results for actionable genetic variants; and 3) 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab (category 2A) for metastatic nonsquamous and 
squamous cell NSCLC with negative test results for actionable genetic 
variants.  
For the 2020 update (Version 4), the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
capmatinib as a first-line therapy or subsequent therapy option (category 
2A; preferred) for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC who are positive 
for METex14 skipping mutations based on preliminary clinical trial data 
and on the FDA approval for capmatinib.294 Crizotinib is also 
recommended as a first-line therapy or subsequent therapy option 
(category 2A; useful in certain circumstances) for certain patients with 
metastatic NSCLC who are positive for METex14 skipping mutations.295 
Capmatinib or crizotinib may be used as subsequent therapy if they were 
not previously given as first-line therapy for METex14 skipping mutation–
positive metastatic NSCLC. The NCCN NSCLC Panel also preference 
stratified regimens that are recommended for METex14 skipping 
mutations and voted that capmatinib is a preferred first-line therapy or

subsequent therapy option for METex14 skipping mutation–positive 
metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial data.294 The panel voted that 
crizotinib is useful in certain circumstances as either a first-line therapy or 
subsequent therapy option for METex14 skipping mutation–positive 
metastatic NSCLC.295 For the Version 4 update, the NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends testing for METex14 skipping mutations (category 2A) in 
certain patients with metastatic NSCLC based on data showing the 
efficacy of capmatinib and crizotinib for patients with METex14 skipping 
mutation–positive metastatic NSCLC and on the FDA approval for 
capmatinib.294,295  
For the 2020 updates (Versions 4 and 7), the NCCN NSCLC Panel 
recommends selpercatinib or pralsetinib as a first-line therapy or 
subsequent therapy options (category 2A; preferred) for eligible patients 
with metastatic NSCLC who are positive for RET rearrangements based 
on preliminary clinical trial data and on the FDA approvals for both 
agents.302,303 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends cabozantinib as a 
first-line therapy or subsequent therapy option (category 2A; useful in 
certain circumstances) for RET rearrangement–positive metastatic 
NSCLC.152,304 The NCCN NSCLC Panel also recommends vandetanib as 
a first-line therapy or subsequent therapy option (category 2B; as useful in 
certain circumstances) for RET rearrangement–positive metastatic 
NSCLC.746 Selpercatinib, pralsetinib, cabozantinib, or vandetanib may be 
used as subsequent therapy if they were not previously given as first-line 
therapy for RET rearrangement–positive metastatic NSCLC. The NCCN 
NSCLC Panel also preference stratified the regimens that are 
recommended for RET rearrangements and voted that selpercatinib and 
pralsetinib are preferred first-line therapy or subsequent therapy options 
for RET rearrangement–positive metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial 
data.302,303,833 The panel decided that cabozantinib (category 2A) and 
vandetanib (category 2B) are both useful in certain circumstances as 
either first-line therapy or subsequent therapy options for RET 
rearrangements.152,304,835 For the Version 4 and 7 updates, the NCCN 
NSCLC Panel recommends testing for RET rearrangements (category 2A) 
in certain patients with metastatic NSCLC based on data showing the 
efficacy of selpercatinib, pralsetinib, cabozantinib, and vandetanib for 
patients with RET rearrangement–positive metastatic NSCLC and on the 
FDA approvals for selpercatinib an pralsetinib.302,303  
For the 2020 update (Version 5), the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
atezolizumab monotherapy as a first-line therapy option (category 2A; 
preferred) for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based on 
preliminary clinical trial data and on the FDA approval.858,859 Atezolizumab 
monotherapy is recommended as a first-line therapy option (category 2A; 
preferred) for patients with metastatic NSCLC, PD-L1 levels of 50% or 
more, and negative test results for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, METex14 skipping, 
RET, or BRAF variants, regardless of histology; maintenance therapy with 
atezolizumab is also recommended in this setting. 
For the 2020 update (Version 6), the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends 
nivolumab/ipilimumab/chemotherapy as a first-line therapy option 
(category 2A; other recommended) for eligible patients with metastatic 
NSCLC based on preliminary clinical trial data and the FDA approval.863 
For metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, the recommended chemotherapy is 
pemetrexed with either cisplatin or carboplatin; for metastatic squamous 
NSCLC, the recommended chemotherapy is paclitaxel with carboplatin. 
Nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus chemotherapy is recommended for 
patients with metastatic NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 levels; negative test 
results for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, METex14 skipping, RET, or BRAF variants; 
and no contraindications to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.
